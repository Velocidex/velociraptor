// Velociraptor implements a slightly different file store than
// GRR. While GRR does block level de-duplication, velociraptor does
// not (only file level deduplication). In practice block level
// de-duplication does not save a lot but makes storage and
// performance a lot more complex. Velociraptor only uses file level
// deduplication.

// The Velociraptor client sends back the buffer and the filename and
// the server saves the entire file directly in the file storage
// filesystem. This allows easy recovery as well as data expiration
// policies (since the filestore is just a directory on disk with
// regular files and timestamps).
