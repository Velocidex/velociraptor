    "ToolLocalDesc":
    <>
      Tool will be served from the Velociraptor server
      to clients if needed. The client will
      cache the tool on its own disk and compare the hash next
      time it is needed. Tools will only be downloaded if their
      hash has changed.
    </>,
    "ServedFromURL": (base_path, url)=>
    <>
      Clients will fetch the tool directly from
      <a href={base_path + url}>{url}</a> if
      needed. Note that if the hash does not match the
      expected hash the clients will reject the file.
    </>,

      Tool URL will be refreshed from

      <b>{github_asset_regex}</b>
    </>,
    "PlaceHolder":
    <>
      Tool hash is currently unknown. The first time the tool
      is needed, Velociraptor will download it from it's
      upstream URL and calculate its hash.
    </>,
    "ToolHash":
    <>
      Tool hash has been calculated. When clients need to use
      this tool they will ensure this hash matches what they
      download.
    </>,
    "AdminOverride":
    <>
      Tool was manually uploaded by an
      admin - it will not be automatically upgraded on the
      next Velociraptor server update.
    </>,
    "ToolError":
    <>
      Tool's hash is not known and no URL
      is defined. It will be impossible to use this tool in an
      artifact because Velociraptor is unable to resolve it. You
      can manually upload a file.
    </>,
    "OverrideToolDesc":
    <>
      As an admin you can manually upload a
      binary to be used as that tool. This will override the
      upstream URL setting and provide your tool to all
      artifacts that need it. Alternative, set a URL for clients
      to fetch tools from.
