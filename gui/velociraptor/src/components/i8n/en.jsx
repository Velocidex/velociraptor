      Tool will be served from the Velociraptor server
      to clients if needed. The client will

      hash has changed.

      Clients will fetch the tool directly from

      Tool hash is currently unknown. The first time the tool

      upstream URL and calculate its hash.
    </>,
    "ToolHash":

      Tool hash has been calculated. When clients need to use
      this tool they will ensure this hash matches what they
      download.

    "ToolError":
    <>
      Tool's hash is not known and no URL
      is defined. It will be impossible to use this tool in an
      artifact because Velociraptor is unable to resolve it. You
      can manually upload a file.
    </>,
    "OverrideToolDesc":
    <>
      As an admin you can manually upload a
      binary to be used as that tool. This will override the
      upstream URL setting and provide your tool to all
      artifacts that need it. Alternative, set a URL for clients
      to fetch tools from.

    Like any system, Velociraptor needs an administrator which is all powerful. This account can run arbitrary VQL on the server, reconfigure the server, etc.  The ability to add/create/edit/remove users is dependent on the organizations to which this account belongs.

    This role provides the ability to read previously collected results but does not allow the user to actually make any changes.  This role is useful to give unpriviledged users visibility into what information is being collected without giving them access to modify anything.

    This role provides the ability to read existing collected data and also run some server side VQL in order to do post processing of this data or annotate it. Analysts typically use the notebook or download collected data offline for post processing existing hunt data. Analysts may not actually start new collections or hunts themselves.

    This role provides the ability to read existing collected data and also run some server side VQL in order to do post processing of this data or annotate it.

    </>,
    "ToolRole_artifact_writer" :
    <>
    This role allows a user to create or modify new client side artifacts (They are not able to modify server side artifacts). This user typically has sufficient understanding and training in VQL to write flexible artifacts. Artifact writers are very powerful as they can easily write a malicious artifact and collect it on the endpoint. Therefore they are equivalent to domain admins on endpoints. You should restrict this role to very few people.
