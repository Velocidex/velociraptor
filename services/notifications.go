// Notifications are low latency indications that something has
// changed. Callers may listen for notifications using the
// ListenForNotification() function which returns a channel. The
// caller can then block on the channel until an event occurs, at
// which time, the channel will be closed.

// Notifications do not carry actual data, they just indicate that an
// event occured. Callers need to go back to actually do something
// with that information (read the filestore etc). Notifications are
// not meant to be reliable - it is possible to miss a notification or
// to receive too many notifications while no change
// occurs. Notifications are just an optimization that reduces the
// need to poll something.
