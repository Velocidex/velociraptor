// Velociraptor is powered by VQL which is a query language. At its
// heart, queries simply return rows. Velociraptor organizes the
// results of queries by the artifact name - that is to say, that
// artifacts return rows when collected, which are stored in the
// datastore under the artifact name.

// The journal service organizes the rows returned from collecting an
// artifact by allowing callers to push them into the datastore (using
// a path manager to figure out exactly where).

// Similarly callers can watch for new rows to appear in any
// artifact. This allows Velociraptor server queries to receive rows
// in real time from client event artifacts.
