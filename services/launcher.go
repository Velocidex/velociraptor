// Many parts of Velociraptor require launching new collections. The
// logic for preparing, verifying, Compiling and launching new
// collections is extracted into a service so it can be accessible
// from many components.

// Velociraptor treats all input as artifacts - users can launch new
// artifact collection on endpoints by naming the artifact and
// providing parameters. However the endpoint itself is not directly
// running the artifacts - it simply runs VQL statements. We do this
// so that artifacts can be edited and customized on the server
// without needing to deploy new clients.

// On the server, collections are created using ArtifactCollectorArgs
// On the client, VQL is executing from VQLCollectorArgs

// Ultimately the launcher is responsible for compiling the requested
// ArtifactCollectorArgs collection into the VQLCollectorArgs protobuf
// that will be sent to the client. Compiling the artifact means:

// 1. Converting the artifact definition into a sequence of VQL

// 2. Populating the query environment from the artifact definition
//    defaults and merging the user's parameters into the initial
//    query environment.

// 3. Include any dependent artifacts in the VQLCollectorArgs. On the
//    client, these additional artifacts will be compiled into a
//    temporary artifact repository for execution (i.e. the client
//    never uses its built in artifacts).

// 4. Adding any required tools by the artifact and filling in their
//    tool details (required hash, and download location).

// Most callers will only need to call ScheduleArtifactCollection()
// which does all the required steps and launches the collection.

// It is possible for callers to pre-compile the artifact and cache
// the VQLCollectorArgs for later use to avoid the cost of compiling
// the artifact. This is useful e.g. in hunts to be able to scale the
// launching of similar collections on many hosts at the same time.
