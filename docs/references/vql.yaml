    Create an array with all the args.

    This function accepts arbitrary arguments and creates an array by
    flattening the arguments. For example `array(a=1, b=2)` will return
    `[1, 2]`.

    You can use this to flatten a subquery as well:

    ```sql
    SELECT array(a1={ SELECT User FROM Artifact.Windows.System.Users() }) as Users FROM scope()
    ```

    Will return a single row with Users being an array of names.

    Parse a binary string with profile based parser.

    This plugin extract binary data from strings. It works by applying
    a profile to the binary string and generating an object from
    that. Profiles use the same syntax as Rekall or Volatility. For
    example a profile might be:

    ```json
    {
      "StructName": [10, {
         "field1": [2, ["unsigned int"]],
         "field2": [6, ["unsigned long long"]],
      }]
    }
    ```

    The profile is compiled and overlayed on top of the offset specified,
    then the object is emitted with its required fields.

    Generate a timestamp periodically. This is mostly useful for event

    This plugin generates events periodically. The periodicity can be
    controlled either via the `period` or the `ms` parameter. Each row
    will be a go [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time)
    object. You can access its unix epoch time with the Sec column.

    ### Example

    The following will generate an event every 10 seconds.

    ```sql
    SELECT Sec FROM clock(period=10)
    ```

    The `start` parameter can be used to schedule the plugin to start
    at a particular time. This can be an integer (which will be
    interpreted as seconds since the epoch), a string or a time value.

    Executes 'query' periodically and emit differences from the last query.

    The `diff()` plugin runs a non-event query periodically and calculates
    the difference between its result set from the last run.

    This can be used to create event queries which watch for changes from
    simpler non-event queries.

    The `key` parameter is the name of the column which is used to
    determine row equivalency.

    {{% notice note %}}

    There is only a single equivalence row specified by the `key`
    parameter, and it must be a string. If you need to watch multiple
    columns you need to create a new column which is the concatenation of
    other columns. For example `format(format="%s%d", args=[Name, Pid])`

    {{% /notice %}}

    When Velociraptor attempts to open a raw socket, sometimes Windows
    Defender treats that as suspicious behavior and quarantines the
    Velociraptor binary. This can be avoided by signing the binary which
    signals to Windows Defender that the binary is legitimate.

    If you do not intend to build Velociraptor from source, use the
    official signed Velociraptor binaries which should not trigger alerts
    from Windows Defender.

    This plugin launches an external command and captures its STDERR,

    This plugin is mostly useful for running arbitrary code on the
    client. If you do not want to allow arbitrary code to run, you can
    disable this by setting the `prevent_execve` flag in the client's
    config file. Be aware than many artifacts require running external
    commands to collect their output though.

    We do not actually transfer the external program to the system
    automatically. If you need to run programs which are not usually
    installed (e.g. Sysinternal's autoruns.exe) you will need to map them
    from a share (requiring direct access to the AD domain) or download
    them using the `http_client()` plugin.

    This function expands environment variables into the path. It is
    normally needed after using registry values of type REG_EXPAND_SZ as
    they typically contain environment strings. Velociraptor does not
    automatically expand such values since environment variables typically
    depend on the specific user account which reads the registry value
    (different user accounts can have different environment variables).

- name: fifo
  description: |
    Executes 'query' and cache a number of rows from it. For each invocation
    we present the set of past rows.

    The `fifo()` plugin allows for VQL queries to apply across historical
    data. The fifo plugin accepts another event query as parameter, then
    retains the last `max_rows` rows from it in an internal queue. Every
    subsequent evaluation from the query will return the full set of rows
    in the queue. Older rows are expired from the queue according to the
    `max_age` parameter.

    Fifos are usually used to form queries that look for specific pattern
    of behavior. For example, a successful logon followed by failed
    logons. In this case the fifo retains the recent history of failed
    logons in its internal queue, then when a successful logon occurs we
    can check the recent failed ones in its queue.

    ### Example

    The following checks for 5 failed logons followed by a successful
    logon.

    ```sql
    LET failed_logon = SELECT EventData as FailedEventData,
       System as FailedSystem
    FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
    WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4625

    LET last_5_events = SELECT FailedEventData, FailedSystem
        FROM fifo(query=failed_logon,
                  max_rows=500,
                  max_age=atoi(string=failedLogonTimeWindow))

    LET success_logon = SELECT EventData as SuccessEventData,
       System as SuccessSystem
    FROM watch_evtx(filename=securityLogFile)
    WHERE System.EventID.Value = 4624

    SELECT * FROM foreach(
      row=success_logon,
      query={
       SELECT SuccessSystem.TimeCreated.SystemTime AS LogonTime,
              SuccessSystem, SuccessEventData,
              enumerate(items=FailedEventData) as FailedEventData,
              FailedSystem, count(items=SuccessSystem) as Count
       FROM last_5_events
       WHERE FailedEventData.SubjectUserName = SuccessEventData.SubjectUserName
       GROUP BY LogonTime
          })  WHERE Count > atoi(string=failureCount)

    Resolves file store paths into full filesystem paths.

    This function is only available on the server. It can be used to
    find the backing file behind a filestore path so it can be passed
    on to an external program.

    Velociraptor uses the concept of a Virtual File System to manage the
    information about clients etc. The VFS path is a path into the file
    store. Of course ultimately (at least in the current implementation)
    the file store is storing files on disk, but the disk filename is not
    necessarily the same as the VFS path (for example non representable
    characters are escaped).

    You can use the `file_store()` function to return the real file path
    on disk. This probably only makes sense for VQL queries running on the
    server which can independently open the file.

    In future the file store may be abstracted (e.g. files may not be
    locally stored at all) and this function may stop working.

- name: glob
  description: |
    Retrieve files based on a list of glob expressions

    The `glob()` plugin is one of the most used plugins. It applies a glob
    expression in order to search for files by file name. The glob
    expression allows for wildcards, alternatives and character
    classes. Globs support both forward and backslashes as path
    separators. They also support quoting to delimit components.

    A glob expression consists of a sequence of components separated by
    path separators. If a separator is included within a component it is
    possible to quote the component to keep it together. For example, the
    windows registry contains keys with forward slash in their
    names. Therefore we may use these to prevent the glob from getting
    confused:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows\"Some Key With http://www.microsoft.com/"\Some Value
    ```

    Glob expressions are case insensitive and may contain the following wild cards:

    * The `*` matches one or more characters.
    * The `?` matches a single character.
    * Alternatives are denoted by braces and comma delimited: `{a,b}`
    * Recursive search is denoted by a `**`. By default this searches 3 directories deep. If you need to increase it you can add a depth number (e.g. `**10`)

    By default globs do not expand environment variables. If you need to
    expand environment variables use the `expand()` function explicitly:

    ```sql
    glob(globs=expand(string="%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\*"))
    ```

    ### Example

    The following searches the raw NTFS disk for event logs.

    ```sql
    SELECT FullPath FROM glob(
    globs="C:\Windows\System32\Winevt\Logs\*.evtx",
    accessor="ntfs")
    ```

    ### The root parameter

    If the root parameter is specified, we start globbing from this
    directory - i.e. the glob pattern is appended to the root
    parameter.  The `root` parameter is useful if the directory name
    itself may contain glob characters.

    Make a http request.

    specified number of bytes per returned row.

    If `disable_ssl_security` is specified we do not enforce SSL
    integrity. This is required to connect to self signed ssl web
    sites. For example many API handlers are exposed over such
    connections.

    {{% notice note %}}

    When connecting to the Velociraptor frontend itself, even in self
    signed mode, we will ensure certs are properly verified. You can
    therefore safely export files from the Frontend's public directory
    over self signed SSL. When connecting to a self signed Velociraptor
    frontend, we ensure the self signed certificate was issued by the
    Velociraptor internal CA - i.e. we pin the Frontend's certificate in
    the binary.

    {{% /notice %}}

    The `http_client()` plugin allows use to interact with any web
    services. If the web service returns a json blob, we can parse it with
    the `parse_json()` function (or `parse_xml()` for SOAP
    endpoints). Using the parameters with a POST method we may actually
    invoke actions from within VQL (e.g. send an SMS via an SMS gateway
    when a VQL event is received).So this is a very powerful plugin.

    When the `tempfile_extension` parameter is provided, the HTTP
    request body will be written to a tempfile with that
    extension. The name of this tempfile will be emitted as the
    Content column.

    This plugin will emit rows with the following columns:
    * Url      string: The url we fetched.
    * Content  string: The body content for this chunk
    * Response int: The HTTP response code (200=success)

    Parses events from a CSV file.

    Parses records from a CSV file. We expect the first row of the CSV
    file to contain column names.  This parser specifically supports
    Velociraptor's own CSV dialect and so it is perfect for post
    processing already existing CSV files.

    The types of each value in each column is deduced based on
    Velociraptor's standard encoding scheme. Therefore types are properly
    preserved when read from the CSV file.

    For example, downloading the results of a hunt in the GUI will produce
    a CSV file containing artifact rows collected from all clients.  We
    can then use the `parse_csv()` plugin to further filter the CSV file,
    or to stack using group by.

    ### Example

    The following stacks the result from a
    `Windows.Applications.Chrome.Extensions` artifact:

    ```sql
    SELECT count(items=User) As TotalUsers, Name
    FROM parse_csv(filename="All Windows.Applications.Chrome.Extensions.csv")

    Parses events from an EVTX file.

    This plugin parses windows events from the Windows Event log files (EVTX).

    A windows event typically contains two columns. The `EventData`
    contains event specific structured data while the `System` column
    contains common data for all events - including the Event ID.

    You should probably almost always filter by one or more event ids
    (using the `System.EventID.Value` field).

    ### Example

    ```sql
    SELECT System.TimeCreated.SystemTime as Timestamp,
           System.EventID.Value as EventID,
           EventData.ImagePath as ImagePath,
           EventData.ServiceName as ServiceName,
           EventData.ServiceType as Type,
           System.Security.UserID as UserSID,

    The regular expressions are specified in the [Go
    syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/). They are expected to
    contain capture variables to name the matches extracted.

    For example, consider a HTML file with simple links. The regular
    expression might be:

    ```
    regex='<a.+?href="(?P<Link>[^"]+?)"'
    ```

    To produce rows with a column Link.

    The aim of this plugin is to split the file into records which can be
    further parsed. For example, if the file consists of multiple records,
    this plugin can be used to extract each record, while
    parse_string_with_regex() can be used to further split each record
    into elements. This works better than trying to write a more complex
    regex which tries to capture a lot of details in one pass.


    ### Example

    Here is an example of parsing the /var/lib/dpkg/status files. These
    files consist of records separated by empty lines:

    ```

    The following query extracts the fields in two passes. The first pass
    uses parse_records_with_regex() to extract records in blocks, while
    using parse_string_with_regex() to further break the block into
    fields.

    ```sql
    SELECT parse_string_with_regex(
       string=Record,
       regex=['Package:\\s(?P<Package>.+)',
         'Installed-Size:\\s(?P<InstalledSize>.+)',

    Patch a JSON object with a json patch or merge.

    The function allows for modifications of objects by way of
    applying a json patch. You can read more about JSON patching here
    https://github.com/evanphx/json-patch.

    I practice you can use this to update server settings - for
    example, consider the client event monitoring state.

    ```text
    SELECT get_client_monitoring() FROM scope()

     [
      {
       "get_client_monitoring": {
        "artifacts": [
         "Generic.Client.Stats"
        ]
       }
      }
     ]
    ```

    Suppose we wish to add a new artifact, we can patch it with the json:
    ```json
    [{"op": "add", "path": "/artifacts/0", "value": "Windows.Events.DNSQueries"}]
    ```

    This can then be immediately pushed to `set_client_monitoring()`
    to update the monitoring state.

    ```
    SELECT set_client_monitoring(value=patch(
           item=get_client_monitoring(),
           patch=[dict(op="add", path="/artifacts/0", value="Windows.Events.DNSQueries")]))

  description: |
    Construct a URL or parse one.

    This function parses or constructs URLs. A URL may be constructed from
    scratch by providing all the components or it may be parsed from an
    existing URL.

    The returned object is a [golang
    URL](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL) and can be serialized again
    using its `String` method.

    This function is important when constructing parameters for certain
    accessors which receive a URL. For example the `zip` accessor requires
    its file names to consist of URLs. The Zip accessor interprets the URL
    in the following way:

    - The scheme is the delegate accessor to use.
    - The path is the delegate accessor's filename
    - The fragment is used by the zip accessor to retrieve the zip member itself.

    In this case it is critical to properly escape each level - it is not
    possible in the general case to simply append strings. You need to use
    the `url()` function to build the proper url.

    Gets the version of a VQL plugin or function.

    This is useful when writing portable VQL which can work with
    older versions of Velociraptor. When Velociraptor plugins evolve
    in an incompatible way their version is incremented. It is
    possible to cater for multiple versions in the VQL using an if()
    plugin.

    For example the following can chose from a legacy query or a
    modern query based on the plugin version:
    ```
     SELECT * FROM if(
      condition=version(plugin="glob") >= 1,
      then=NewQuery,

    It often takes several seconds for events to be flushed to the event
    log and so this plugin's event may be delayed. For some applications
    this results in a race condition with the event itself - for example,
    files mentioned in the event may already be removed by the time the

    Scan files using yara rules.

    The `yara()` plugin applies a signature consisting of multiple rules
    across files. You can read more about [yara rules](https://yara.readthedocs.io/en/v3.4.0/writingrules.html). The
    accessor is used to open the various files which allows this plugin to
    work across raw ntfs, zip members etc.

    Scanning proceeds by reading a block from the file, then applying the
    yara rule on the block. This will fail if the signature is split
    across block boundary. You can choose the block size to be
    appropriate.

    Note that because we are just scanning the file data, yara plugins
    like the pe plugin will not work. You can emulate all the yara plugins
    with VQL anyway (e.g. to test for pe headers)

    Typically the yara rule does not change for the life of the query, so
    we cache it to avoid having to recompile it each time. The `key`
    variable can be used to uniquely identify the cache key for the
    rule. If the `key` variable is not specified, we use the rule text
    itself to generate the cache key. It is recommended that the `key`
    parameter be specified because it makes it more efficient.

    ### Shorthand rules

    This plugin accepts yara rules in the `rules` parameter. But typically
    we only search for keywords so writing a full yara syntax rule is
    tedious. Therefore we provide a shorthand way to specify the
    keywords. For example:

    ```
    wide nocase:foo,bar,baz
    ```

    When the rule is provided in the above form, the plugin will
    automatically generate a yara rule which matches any of the specified
    keywords. The specification before the `:` means the same thing as the
    yara DSL and the following combinations are supported `wide`, `wide
    ascii`, `wide nocase`, `wide nocase ascii`.


    {{% notice note %}}

    By default only the first 100mb of the file are scanned and
    scanning stops after one hit is found.

    {{% /notice %}}
