  description: |
    Create an array.

    This function is the array constructor. It can be used to build an
    array from a number of args (Note that since VQL always uses
    keyword args you need to give each arg a name but this name is
    actually ignored in this function):

    ```vql
    array(a=1, b=2) -> [1, 2]
    ```

    The function does not flatten the arguments so providing lists as
    parameters will form a nested list:

    ```vql
    array(a=[1,2]) -> [ [1, 2] ]
    ```

    You can use the `_` argument to build the array from another
    object:

    ```vql
    array(_=[1, 2]) -> [1, 2]
    ```

    You can use a subquery to built the object from another
    query. This is called `materializing` the query because the query
    will be expanded into memory (be careful about materializing a
    very large query here!)

    Note that materializing a query will give a list of dicts() since
    each row in a query is a dict.

    ```vql
    array(_={ SELECT User FROM Artifact.Windows.System.Users() }) -> [{"User": "Bob"}, {"User": "Fred"}]
    ```

    To collapse to a simple list of users, simply reference the User
    field:

    ```vql
    array(_={ SELECT User FROM Artifact.Windows.System.Users() }).User -> ["Bob", "Fred"]
    ```

    This works because the `.` operator on a list, creates another
    list with the `.` operator applying on each member.

    Sets metadata about the artifact.

    This VQL function is used to clean up the artifact search screen
    and guide users to assist with investigations.

    Velociraptor comes with a lot of built in artifacts which may be
    confusing to some users and in specialized deployments it may be
    preferable to guide users into a small subset of artifacts and
    hide the rest.

    For example, say you have a set of custom artifacts that you only
    want to show. Then I would add a special keyword to their
    description (for example a company name - say "Written by ACME
    inc"). Then a query like this will hide the others:

    ```vql
    SELECT name, artifact_set_metadata(name=name, hidden=TRUE)
    FROM artifact_definitions() WHERE NOT description =~ "ACME"
    ```

- name: auto
  description: |
    Access the file using the best accessor possible.

    The `auto` accessor is the default accessor that is used when a VQL
    query does not specify an `accessor` parameter.

    On Windows it attempts to open the file using the `file` accessor and
    if that fails (for example due to permission errors), the `auto`
    accessor automatically tries the `ntfs` accessor to access the file
    using raw level filesystem parsing.

    The overall effect is that the Velociraptor is able to transparently
    access files that are locked (for example registry hives) or are
    protected by filter drivers (e.g. some endpoint security software). In
    general you should use the `auto` accessor to open files on the local
    filesystem in all cases since it will be much faster than using the
    `ntfs` accessor for every file (most files are not actually locked).

    On other operating systems, the `auto` accessor is an alias to the
    `file` accessor.

- name: bzip2
  description: |
    Access the content of bzip2 files.

    The bzip2 accessor is able to read the content of `bz2` compressed
    files. It is very similar to the `gzip` accessor.

    Since `bzip2` compressed files do not have an actual file hierarchy,
    they can not be directly searched with `glob()`. This accessor is
    therefore only really useful for opening the file for reading - or for
    chaining with another accessor.

    ```vql
    SELECT read_file(accessor="bzip2", filename="F:/hello.txt.bz2", length=10)
    FROM scope()
    ```

    Performance: Bzip2 files are non-seekable. This means they must be
    read in sequence from start to finish. If the VQL query attempts to
    seek within the file, this accessor will automatically decompress the
    entire file into a temporary file so it can seek within it. This means
    that performance can be extremely bad in some cases.

  description: |
    Creates a cache object.

    A Cache is a data structure which is used to speed up calculating
    data by keeping it's value in memory. A cache is essentially a key
    value store - when the key is accessed, the function will be
    calculated producing a value. If the key is accessed again, the
    value is returned from the cache without calculating it again.

    For example consider the following:

    ```vql
        LET get_pid_query(Lpid) =
           SELECT Pid, Ppid, Name FROM pslist(pid=Lpid)

        SELECT cache(func=get_pid_query(Lpid=Pid), key=str(str=Pid))
        FROM ....
    ```

    The cache will ensure that get_pid_query() is only called once per
    unique Pid by comparing the key against the internal memory store.

    Returns client info (like the fqdn) from the datastore.

    Velociraptor maintains basic information about the client in the
    data store, such as its hostname, OS etc.

    You can use this function to enrich information about clients in
    VQL output. NOTE: This function queries the internal in-memory
    database so it is very fast and suitable to be called frequently
    on each row.

    ### Example - enriching hostnames

    Internally, Velociraptor uses client id to uniquely identify the
    client. But often we want to provide a hostname as well. In the
    below we look at collection output from the `source()` plugin and
    add an additional Hostname column by resolving the client id on
    each row to its hostname.

    ```vql
    SELECT *,
       client_info(client_id=client_id).os_info.hostname AS Hostname
    FROM source()
    ```

    Client metadata is a set of free form key/value data (see

    For existing keys, the value is overwritten. Setting a metadata
    key with a `NULL` value deletes that entry.

    Generate a timestamp periodically. This is mostly useful for event

    This plugin generates events periodically. The periodicity can be

    will be a go [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time)
    object. You can access its unix epoch time with the Sec column.

    ### Example

    The following will generate an event every 10 seconds.

    ```vql
    SELECT Second FROM clock(period=10)
    ```

    The `start` parameter can be used to schedule the plugin to start
    at a particular time. This can be an integer (which will be
    interpreted as seconds since the epoch), a string or a time value.

  description: |
    Launch an artifact collection against a client. If the client_id
    is "server" then the collection occurs on the server itself. In
    that case the caller needs the SERVER_ADMIN permission.

    There are two way of specifying how to collect the artifacts. The
    simplest way is to specify the environment string using the `env`
    parameter, and a list of artifacts to collect in the `artifacts`
    parameter.

    In this case all artifacts will receive the the same
    parameters. For example:

    ```vql
    SELECT collect_client(
        client_id='C.11a3013ccaXXXXX',
        artifacts='Windows.KapeFiles.Targets',
        env=dict(Device ='C:', VSSAnalysis='Y', KapeTriage='Y')).request AS Flow
    FROM scope()
    ```

    Sometimes we have a number of artifacts that use the same
    parameter name for different purposes. In that case we wish to
    specify precisely which artifact receives which parameter. This
    more complex way of specifying the collection using the `spec`
    parameter:

    ```vql
    SELECT collect_client(
        client_id='C.11a3013ccaXXXXX',
        artifacts='Windows.KapeFiles.Targets',
        spec=dict(`Windows.KapeFiles.Targets`=dict(
            Device ='C:', VSSAnalysis='Y', KapeTriage='Y'))).request AS Flow
    FROM scope()
    ```

    In this case the artifact names are repeated in the spec and the
    artifacts parameter.

    NOTE: When constructing the dictionaries for the spec parameter
    you will often need to specify a field name containing full
    stop. You can escape this using the backticks like the example above.

    ### Example - conditional collections

    In this example we wish to create an artifact with check buttons
    for selecting groups of artifacts to launch. Assume `Do1` and
    `Do2` are boolean parameters:

    1. Depending on the checkbox condition we set a set of dicts and
       potential arguments.

    2. Next we rely on the fact that dict additions merge the keys of
       each dict to create a merged dict. The `Spec` dict is
       constructed by joining the different parts together

    3. To obtain the list of unique artifacts we use the `items()`
       plugin to extract the keys from the spec dict.

    ```vql
    LET X1 = if(condition=Do1, then=dict(`Generic.Client.Info`=dict()), else=dict())
    LET X2 = if(condition=Do2, then=dict(`Generic.System.Pstree`=dict()), else=dict())

    LET Spec = X1 + X2

    LET ArtifactNames = SELECT _key FROM items(item=Spec)

    SELECT collect_client(
             spec=Spec,
             artifacts=ArtifactNames._key,
             client_id='C.49982ba4c2ccef20') AS collection
    FROM scope()

    Sometimes a query produces a large number of columns or

    You can use the column_filter() plugin to select a subset of the
    columns to include or exclude from an underlying query. For example:

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM column_filter(
    query={
       SELECT 1 AS A, 2 AS B, 3 AS AB, 4 AS AA
       FROM scope()
    }, include="A", exclude="B")
    ```

    will include columns with the letter A in their name and remove
    columns with the letter B (so it will have A and AA above).

    Construct a dict from arbitrary keyword args.

    This function creates a dictionary (a key/value map). NOTE: In VQL
    dictionaries always have string keys. Sometimes key names contain
    special characters like dots etc, in that case you can use
    backticks to escape the name. For example:

    ```vql
    SELECT dict(Foo="Bar", `Name.With.Dots`="Baz")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    See the `to_dict()` function to create dicts from a query with

  description: |
    Executes 'query' periodically and emit differences from the last query.

    The `diff()` plugin runs a non-event query periodically and calculates
    the difference between its result set from the last run.

    This can be used to create event queries which watch for changes from
    simpler non-event queries.

    The `key` parameter is the name of the column which is used to
    determine row equivalency.

    {{% notice note %}}

    There is only a single equivalence column specified by the `key`
    parameter, and it must be a string. If you need to watch multiple
    columns you need to create a new column which is the concatenation
    of other columns. For example `format(format="%s%d", args=[Name,
    Pid])`

    {{% /notice %}}

    ### Example

    The following VQL monitors all removable drives and lists files on
    newly inserted drives, or files that have been added to removable
    drives.

    ```vql
    LET removable_disks = SELECT Name AS Drive, Size
    FROM glob(globs="/*", accessor="file")
    WHERE Data.Description =~ "Removable"

    LET file_listing = SELECT FullPath, Mtime As Modified, Size
    FROM glob(globs=Drive+"\\**", accessor="file") LIMIT 1000

    SELECT * FROM diff(
      query={ SELECT * FROM foreach(row=removable_disks, query=file_listing) },
      key="FullPath",
      period=10)
      WHERE Diff = "added"
    ```

    ### Example - waiting for process exit

    Although `diff()` is primarily an event query it can also be
    useful in regular client side VQL. For example we might need to
    wait for a process to exit before continuing. The following query
    blocks until the process list does not contain a process matching
    the regex.

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM diff(key="Name", period=1, query={
       SELECT Name FROM pslist()
       WHERE Name =~ ProcessRegex
    })
    WHERE Diff =~ "removed"
    LIMIT 1
    ```

    This query:

    1. Diff will list processes every second looking for process name
       matching the regex.
    2. When a process is added or removed, the diff plugin will emit a
       row
    3. The query is only interested in a removed process
    4. After a single removed process is found the limit is reached
       and the query exits.

    Sometimes we need to wait for a subprocess to exist if it detaches
    from the terminal immediately but does some work in the background.

    When Velociraptor attempts to open a raw socket, sometimes Windows
    Defender treats that as suspicious behavior and quarantines the
    Velociraptor binary. This can be avoided by signing the binary which
    signals to Windows Defender that the binary is legitimate.

    If you do not intend to build Velociraptor from source, use the
    official signed Velociraptor binaries which should not trigger alerts

    Evaluate a vql lambda function on the current scope.

    This allows you to use a string as a VQL function - the string

    all parts of the same volume set if the file name ends with a '.E01'.

    ### Example

    ```vql

- name: execve
  description: |
    This plugin launches an external command and captures its STDERR,
    STDOUT and return code. The command's stdout is split using the `sep`
    parameter as required.

    This plugin is mostly useful for running arbitrary code on the
    client. If you do not want to allow arbitrary code to run, you can
    disable this by setting the `prevent_execve` flag in the client's
    config file. Be aware than many artifacts require running external
    commands to collect their output though.

    We do not actually transfer the external program to the system
    automatically. If you need to run programs which are not usually
    installed (e.g. Sysinternal's autoruns.exe) you will need to use
    Velociraptor's external tools feature to deliver and manage the
    tools on the client.

    https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/extending_vql/#using-external-tools

    NOTE: The plugin receives an array of arguments which are passed
    to the `execve()` system call as an array (on Windows they are
    properly escaped into a command line). This means that you do not
    need to escape or quote any special characters in the command.

    We noticed people often do this or variations on it:
    ```vql
    LET PathToCacls = "C:/Program Files"
    LET CommandLine <= "cacls.exe " + '"' + PathToCacls + '"'
    SELECT * FROM execve(argv=["powershell", "-c", CommandLine])
    ```

    While this appears to work it is incorrect, fragile and
    susceptible to a simple shell injection (for example if the
    `PathToCacls` contains quotes).

    As a rule we prefer to not run commands through the shell at all
    since it is not needed and unsafe. The correct approach is always
    to split the `argv` into an array of distinct arguments:

    ```vql
    LET PathToCacls = "C:/Program Files"
    SELECT * FROM execve(argv=["cacls.exe", PathToCacls])
    ```

    This calls the program directly and is not susceptible to escaping
    or quoting issues (since there is no shell involved). Additionally
    it does not invoke powershell which means that any execution
    artifacts are not trampled by this VQL.

    Expand the path using the environment.

    This function expands environment variables into the path. It is
    normally needed after using registry values of type REG_EXPAND_SZ as
    they typically contain environment strings. Velociraptor does not
    automatically expand such values since environment variables typically
    depend on the specific user account which reads the registry value
    (different user accounts can have different environment variables).

    This function uses the Golang standard for expanding variables
    (using $varname ). On Windows, we also support using the Windows
    notation with % before and after the variable name.

    ```vql
    SELECT expand(path="My Username is %USERNAME%")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    NOTE: The environment strings are set per user and Velociraptor's
    own environment may not reflect any other process's
    environment. See `Windows.Forensics.ProcessInfo` for a

  description: |
    Executes 'query' and cache a number of rows from it. For each invocation
    we present the set of past rows.

    The `fifo()` plugin allows for VQL queries to apply across historical
    data. The fifo plugin accepts another event query as parameter, then
    retains the last `max_rows` rows from it in an internal queue. Every
    subsequent evaluation from the query will return the full set of rows
    in the queue. Older rows are expired from the queue according to the
    `max_age` parameter.

    Fifos are usually used to form queries that look for specific pattern
    of behavior. For example, a successful logon followed by failed
    logons. In this case the fifo retains the recent history of failed
    logons in its internal queue, then when a successful logon occurs we
    can check the recent failed ones in its queue.

    ### Example

    The following checks for 5 failed logons followed by a successful
    logon.

    ```vql
    LET failed_logon = SELECT EventData as FailedEventData,
       System as FailedSystem

    NOTE: This accessor does not follow symbolic links on `Windows` or
    `Linux` in order to avoid being trapped by cycles. This means that
    on some Linux systems you will find `/usr/bin/ls` instead of
    `/bin/ls` since `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin/`

    On Linux this accessor implements case insensitive comparisons

    are trying to use artifacts written for Windows - they may fail
    due to incorrect casing making it impossible to find the right

    Resolves file store paths into full filesystem paths.

    This function is only available on the server. It can be used to
    find the backing file behind a filestore path so it can be passed
    on to an external program.

    Velociraptor uses the concept of a Virtual File System to manage the
    information about clients etc. The VFS path is a path into the file
    store. Of course ultimately (at least in the current implementation)
    the file store is storing files on disk, but the disk filename is not
    necessarily the same as the VFS path (for example non-representable
    characters are escaped).

    You can use the `file_store()` function to return the real file path
    on disk. This probably only makes sense for VQL queries running on the
    server which can independently open the file.

    In future the file store may be abstracted (e.g. files may not be
    locally stored at all) and this function may stop working.

  description: |
    Create a named generator that receives rows from the query.

    This plugin allow multiple queries to efficiently filter rows from
    the same query.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    LET SystemLog = generate(query={
       SELECT * FROM parse_evtx(filename='''C:\Windows\system32\winevt\logs\System.evtx''')
    })

    SELECT timestamp(epoch=System.TimeCreated.SystemTime) AS Timestamp,
       Type, EventData
    FROM combine(
    a={
      SELECT *, "Kernel Driver Install" AS Type
      FROM SystemLog
      WHERE System.EventID.Value = 7045 AND EventData.ServiceType =~ "kernel"
    }, b={
      SELECT *, "Log File Cleared" AS Type,
                UserData.LogFileCleared AS EventData
      FROM SystemLog
      WHERE System.EventID.Value = 104
    })
    ```

    NOTE: The `generate()` function produces a stored query that can be
    used as the target of any `SELECT ... FROM` statement. Therefore
    it does not make sense to materialize the output of `generate()`
    because it is equivalent to materializing the actual target query
    itself.

    In other words this:

    ```vql
    LET X <= generate(query={ SELECT * FROM watch_etw(...) })
    ```

    Will attempt to enumerate the target query into an array and is
    equivalent to:

    ```vql
    LET X <= SELECT * FROM watch_etw(...)
    ```

    Neither of those queries will terminate as VQL waits for them to
    produce all their rows before moving to the next statement but the
    `watch_etw()` query will never terminate since it is an event
    query.

- name: glob
  description: |
    Retrieve files based on a list of glob expressions

    The `glob()` plugin is one of the most used plugins. It applies a glob
    expression in order to search for files by file name. The glob
    expression allows for wildcards, alternatives and character
    classes. Globs support both forward and backslashes as path
    separators. They also support quoting to delimit components.

    A glob expression consists of a sequence of components separated by
    path separators. If a separator is included within a component it is
    possible to quote the component to keep it together. For example, the
    windows registry contains keys with forward slash in their
    names. Therefore we may use these to prevent the glob from getting
    confused:

    ```
    HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows\"Some Key With http://www.microsoft.com/"\Some Value
    ```

    Glob expressions are case insensitive and may contain the following wild cards:

    * The `*` matches one or more characters.
    * The `?` matches a single character.
    * Alternatives are denoted by braces and comma delimited: `{a,b}`
    * Recursive search is denoted by a `**`. By default this searches 3 directories deep. If you need to increase it you can add a depth number (e.g. `**10`)

    By default globs do not expand environment variables. If you need to
    expand environment variables use the `expand()` function explicitly:

    ```vql
    glob(globs=expand(string="%SystemRoot%\System32\Winevt\Logs\*"))
    ```

    ### Example

    The following searches the raw NTFS disk for event logs.

    ```vql
    SELECT FullPath FROM glob(
    globs="C:\Windows\System32\Winevt\Logs\*.evtx",
    accessor="ntfs")
    ```

    ### The root parameter

    If the root parameter is specified, we start globbing from this
    directory - i.e. the glob pattern is appended to the root
    parameter.  The `root` parameter is useful if the directory name
    itself may contain glob characters.

    ### Following symlinks

    On Unix like operating systems symlinks are used
    extensively. Symlinks complicate the job of the glob() plugin
    because they break the assumption that filesystems are
    trees. Instead a symlink may form a cycle or create very deep
    directories within the filesystem.

    By default glob() follows symlinks but also checks for cycles by
    checking that a target of a symlink has not been seen before. You
    can disable this behavior with `nosymlink=TRUE`

    ### Setting a recursion callback

    Sometimes it is useful to prevent glob() from recursing into a
    directory. For example, if we know a directory can not possibly
    contain a hit we can avoid descending into it at all. This more
    efficient than simply eliminating the matching rows in the WHERE
    clause.

    You can provide a recursion callback (in the form of a VQL lambda
    function) to let glob() know if it should be recursing a
    directory. The glob() plugin will call the lambda with current
    directory entry and if the lambda returns a `true` value will
    recurse into it.

    For example consider the following query which searches for pem
    files in all directories other than /proc, /sys or /snap

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM glob(globs='/**/*.pem',
        recursion_callback="x=>NOT x.OSPath =~ '^/(proc|sys|snap)'")
    ```

    ### A note about escaping.

    Windows paths often contain backslashes which are difficult to
    work with because they need to be escaped both by regular
    expressions **and** VQL strings.

    This means that trying to add a recursion callback will expand
    each backslash into 8 backslashes (once for regular expressions
    and twice for nested strings).

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM glob(
      globs="C:/Users/*/*",
      recursion_callback="x=> NOT x.OSPath =~ 'C:\\\\\\\\Users\\\\\\\\Admini'")
    ```

    It is a bit easier to use variables and raw strings

    ```vql
    LET Exclude <= '''C:\\Users\\Admin'''

    SELECT * FROM glob(
      globs="C:/Users/*/*",
      recursion_callback="x=> NOT x.OSPath =~ Exclude")

  description: |
    Access the content of gzip files.

    The filename is a pathspec with a delegate accessor opening the
    actual gzip file.

    Since `gzip` compressed files do not have an actual file hierarchy,
    they can not be directly searched with `glob()`. This accessor is
    therefore only really useful for opening the file for reading - or for
    chaining with another accessor.

    ```vql
    SELECT read_file(accessor="gzip", filename="F:/hello.txt.gz", length=10)
    FROM scope()
    ```

    Performance: `GZIP` files are non-seekable. This means they must be
    read in sequence from start to finish. If the VQL query attempts to
    seek within the file, this accessor will automatically decompress the
    entire file into a temporary file so it can seek within it. This means
    that performance can be extremely bad in some cases.

    Perform a DNS resolution.

    This function allows DNS to be resolved from within VQL. You can
    use the regular system resolver (for example on windows will go
    through the resolver cache service).

    You can also specify an external DNS server, causing the query to
    contact the DNS server for resolving the names.

    NOTE: No caching is currently provided so this may generate a lot
    of load on DNS servers when scanning many rows.

    ### Example

    The first query resolves through an external DNS server
    while the second uses the local resolver.

    ```

  description: |
    Make a http request.

    This plugin makes a HTTP connection using the specified method. The
    headers and parameters may be specified. The plugin reads the
    specified number of bytes per returned row.

    If `disable_ssl_security` is specified we do not enforce SSL
    integrity. This is required to connect to self signed ssl web
    sites. For example many API handlers are exposed over such
    connections.

    {{% notice note %}}

    When connecting to the Velociraptor frontend itself, even in self
    signed mode, we will ensure certs are properly verified. You can
    therefore safely export files from the Frontend's public directory
    over self signed SSL. When connecting to a self signed Velociraptor
    frontend, we ensure the self signed certificate was issued by the
    Velociraptor internal CA - i.e. we pin the Frontend's certificate in
    the binary.

    {{% /notice %}}

    The `http_client()` plugin allows use to interact with any web
    services. If the web service returns a json blob, we can parse it
    with the `parse_json()` function (or `parse_xml()` for SOAP
    endpoints). Using the parameters with a POST method we may
    actually invoke actions from within VQL (e.g. send an SMS via an
    SMS gateway when a VQL event is received). So this is a very
    powerful plugin - see examples below.

    When the `tempfile_extension` parameter is provided, the HTTP
    response body will be written to a tempfile with that
    extension. The name of this tempfile will be emitted as the
    `Content` column.

    This plugin will emit rows with the following columns:
    * Url      string: The url we fetched.
    * Content  string: The body content for this chunk
    * Response int: The HTTP response code (200=success)

    ### Example

    The following VQL returns the client's external IP as seen by the
    externalip service.

    ```vql
    SELECT Content as IP from http_client(url='http://www.myexternalip.com/raw')
    ```

    You can use this plugin to download file contents by passing the
    `tempfile_extension` parameter. In this case this plugin will
    create a new temp file with the specified extension, write the
    content of the HTTP request into it and then emit a row with
    `Content` being the name of the file. The file will be
    automatically removed when the query ends.

    ### Example - Uploading files

    Many API handlers support uploading files via POST messages. This
    is supported using the `files` parameter for this plugin. The
    plugin will automatically switch to `multipart/form` mode and
    stream the file content. This allows you to upload very large
    files with minimal memory impact. Here is an example:

    ```vql
    SELECT *
    FROM http_client(
        url='http://localhost:8002/test/',
        method='POST',
        files=dict(file='file.txt', key='file', path='/etc/passwd', accessor="file")
    )
    ```
    Here the files can be an array of dicts with the following fields:
    * file: The name of the file that will be stored on the server
    * key: The name of the form element that will receive the file
    * path: This is an OSPath object that we open and stream into the form.
    * accessor: Any accessor required for the path.

    `spec` parameter (see example below).

    ### NOTES

    1. In the GUI hunts are always created in the paused
    state. This is not the default state when using this function (all
    hunts are immediately active - if you want the hunt to be created
    in the paused state provide the `pause=TRUE` parameter).

    2. The expiry time is specified in any of the usual time
    specification ways (seconds since epoch, or ISO format like
    "2021-10-02"). If the expiry time is in the past, the hunt will
    not be created.

    ```vql

    Assign a client to a hunt.

    This function allows a client to be added to a hunt. The client
    will be immediately scheduled and the results will be added to the
    hunt. Clients are added to a hunt regardless of any hunt
    conditions, or even if the hunt is stopped.

    You can use this function to manually add clients to selected
    hunts for example after being triaged or post processed to
    identify the clients of interest.

    NOTE: An alternative method is to create a hunt that only targets
    a specific label and then just assign the label to specific
    clients.

    ### Adding an existing flow to a hunt.

    If a flow_id is specified, this function will just immediately add
    the collection to the hunt, without scheduling a new
    collection. The results of this flow will be visible when post
    processing the hunt, exporting the hunt etc.

    This is useful to redo a collection in a hunt - for example, if
    some collections in the hunt expired or were cancelled you can
    manually re-run these collections and then when successful re-add
    them to the hunt.

    Format an IP address.

    Converts an ip address encoded in various ways. If the IP address is
    encoded as 32 bit integer we can use netaddr4_le or netaddr4_be to
    print it in a human readable way.

    This function wraps the Golang net.IP library
    (https://pkg.go.dev/net#IP ). This makes it easy to deal with
    various IP address notations. Some use cases:

    ### Example - Parse IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses

    ```vql
    SELECT ip(parse='0:0:0:0:0:FFFF:129.144.52.38') FROM scope()
    ```

    Will return the string "129.144.52.38"

    ### Example - Get information about IP addresses

    VQL will also expose the following attributes of the IP address:

    - `IsGlobalUnicast`
    - `IsInterfaceLocalMulticast`
    - `IsLinkLocalMulticast`
    - `IsLinkLocalUnicast`
    - `IsLoopback`
    - `IsMulticast`
    - `IsPrivate`

    ```vql
    SELECT ip(parse='192.168.1.2').IsPrivate FROM scope()
    ```

    Return "true" since this is a private address block.

    Iterate over dict members producing _key and _value columns

- name: items
  description: |
    Enumerate all members of the item (similar to Python's items() method).

    This plugin allows iteration over dicts or queries.

    ### Iterating dicts

    If the item is a dict, then this plugin will iterate over its keys
    and values producing two columns:

    * The `_key` column is the dictionary key
    * The `_value` column is the dictionary value

    ### Iterating queries

    For queries or arrays, the `items()` plugin will produce two columns:

    * The `_key` column is the row index starting from 0
    * The `_value` column is the row itself as a dict.

    The `items()` query is useful to treat the results of another
    query as a dict instead of a row. This is useful when the query
    produces unpredictable columns or you need to operate over the
    column names somehow.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM items(item={ SELECT * FROM info() })
    ```

    Produces:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "_key": 0,
        "_value": {
          "Hostname": "DESKTOP-BTI2T9T",

    Access the NTFS filesystem by parsing NTFS structures.

    This accessor is a variation of the `ntfs` accessor. It is a bit
    faster because it does not enumerate all the attributes in files
    contained in directories, instead relying only on the `I30` index
    streams. This means it is unable to find Alternate Data Streams in
    directories (because ADS are not stored in the I30 stream).

    Usually the extra performance is not worth these limitations since the
    `ntfs` accessor is pretty fast these days already.

  description: |
    Create a url linking to a particular part in the Velociraptor GUI.

    This function knows about how Velociraptor web app is routed
    internally and can help you generate a valid URL that links into
    the app. You can then use this URL to share a reference via
    e.g. email, slack or other means.

    The links generated will be in markdown format by default (i.e. of
    the for `[Text](url)`). If you need a raw link without the text,
    specify the `raw` parameter as TRUE.

    If a link text is not supplied, this function will create a
    default text message:

    * For client links this text will also include the hostname
    * For artifact links, this will include the artifact name
    * For hunt, flows etc the text will be the hunt id, flow id etc.

    By default the link will refer to the current org but you can
    override this with the org id.

    If you want to display the links in the notebook within the GUI
    table you will need to set the column type to `url_internal` or
    `url`.

    NOTE: This function makes no effort to check if the link is
    actually valid - i.e. it does not check that the client id refers
    to a real client, flow id to a real flow, etc.

    ### Example

    ```sql
    // Setting this in a notebook will tell the GUI to treat this
    // column as URL.
    LET ColumnTypes <= dict(HuntLink="url_internal")

    SELECT link_to(hunt_id="H.1234") AS HuntLink,
           link_to(client_id="C.123", flow_id="F.123") AS FlowLink,
           link_to(client_id="C.123") AS ClientLink,
           link_to(client_id="C.123", artifact="Custom.Artifact.Name",
                   text='Event link') AS ArtifactLink,
           link_to(artifact="Custom.Artifact.Name"),

- name: log
  description: |
    Log the message and return TRUE.

    The message will be logged into the query log stream (Viewable in
    the Logs tab). The `message` parameter represents a format string
    that will be expanded using the `args` parameter list if needed.

    Since `log()` always returns TRUE it is easy to use in a WHERE
    clause as a form of debugging (It is basically equivalent to the
    print statement of other languages).

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM glob(...)
    WHERE log(message="Value of OSPath is %v", args=OSPath)
    ```

    ### Deduplication

    Log messages will be deduped according to the `dedup`
    parameter - each distinct format string will not be emitted more
    frequently than the `dedup` parameter (by default 60 seconds).

    This makes it safe to use `log()` frequently without overflowing
    the logs stream.

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM range(end=_value)
    WHERE log(message="Value is %v", args=_value)
    ```

    Will only emit a single message due to the format string being
    deduped.

    This property makes it useful to add progress logging to long
    running artifacts. The logs will be emitted every minute.

    SELECT * FROM glob(...)
    WHERE log(message="Processing file %v", args=OSPath)

    Creates an LRU object

    A LRU is like a dict, except that older items are expired. It is

    An example of this query is maintaining lookups between Kernel
    objects and key names within the Windows Kernel Registry provider.

    ```vql
    LET Cache <= lru()

    SELECT *, EventData,
        get(item=Cache, field=EventData.KeyObject) AS KeyName

                value=EventData.RelativeName),
       else=TRUE)
    ```

    Note how `set()` can be used to add items to the cache and `get()`
    is used to retrieve items.

  description: |
    Identify a file using magic rules.

    Magic rules are designed to identify a file based on a sequence of
    tests. They are a great way of quickly triaging a file type based
    on its content, not its name.

    Detection is facilitated via libmagic - a common library powering
    the unix "file" utility. Velociraptor comes with all of "file"
    basic magic signatures.

    You can also write your own signatures using the magic syntax (see
    https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/magic.4.html )

    ### Example

    The following will check all files in /var/lib applying a custom
    magic rule.

    ```vql
    LET Magic = '''
    0 search/1024 "GET Apache Logs
    !:strength + 100
    '''

    SELECT FullPath, Size, magic(path=FullPath, magic=Magic)
    FROM glob(globs="/var/lib/*")
    ```

    NOTE: `magic()` requires reading the headers of each file which
    causes the file to be opened. If you have on-access scanning such
    as Windows Defender "Realtime monitoring", applying magic() on
    many files (e.g. in a glob) may result in substantial load on the
    endpoint.

    Access files bundled inside the Velociraptor binary itself.

    The `me` accessor is used to retrieve files packed inside the
    Velociraptor binary (for example in the offline
    collector). Currently this is similar to the zip accessor but it
    might change in future. Do not use this accessor directly, instead
    use the supported `Generic.Utils.FetchBinary` artifact to retrieve
    packed files.

    This is used for unpacking extra files delivered by the Offline
    Collector and is probably not generally useful.

    Memoize a query into memory.

    Memoizing a query means to cache the results of the query so they
    can be accessed quickly.

    Consider the following query:

    ```vql
    LET ProcessDetails(ProcessPid) = SELECT Name, Pid, Ppid FROM pslist()
      WHERE Pid=ProcessPid
    ```

    This query retrieves the process details for any Pid such as the
    Name, Pid and parent Pid.

    While this query works, imagine having to use it in a large query
    to resolve many different processes. Each time the function is
    called the pslist() plugin is run over all processes and the
    correct process is selected - this can lead to thousands of
    pslist() executions!

    We can solve this by memoizing the results of the query -
    i.e. storing them in memory and retrieving a single row based on a
    key.

    ```vql
    LET m <= memoize(query={
       SELECT str(str=Pid) AS Key, Name, Pid, Ppid FROM pslist()
    }, key='Key')
    ```

    The `memoize()` function looks like a `dict()` and when accessed
    will automatically run the query once and cache its rows. The Key
    column of the query is used as the key of the dict.

    You can access the cache using the `get()` function or the `.`
    operator. If the key matches the entire row is retrieved:

    ```vql
    SELECT get(item=m, field=str(str=Pid)).Name AS ProcessName
    FROM source()
    ```

    The `mft` accessor is used to access arbitrary MFT streams as

    The filename is taken as an MFT inode number in the form
    `<entry_id>-<stream_type>-<id>`, e.g. `203-128-0`. The first
    component of the file is the device number to open (e.g. `C:`)

    This accessor does not support directories and so can not be used
    in `glob()`

    Access the NTFS filesystem by parsing NTFS structures.

    This accessor uses an NTFS parser to present the content of the
    NTFS filesystem as a simple filesystem. It emulates the regular
    `file` accessor and its interpretation of the paths:

    1. At the top level of the filesystem, this accessor enumerates all
    fixed drives and VSS devices to present a list of valid devices
    that may be parsed. For example a glob of `/*` gives:

    - `\\.\C:` - The C drive device
    - `\\\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy1` - The first VSS device.

    2. The accessor will automatically convert from Windows paths to
    NTFS paths. For example the path `C:/Windows` will be converted to
    `\\.\C:\Windows`

    This accessor is only available on Windows.

    See the `raw_ntfs` accessor for more information and comparisons.

    Access the NTFS filesystem by considering all VSS.

    This accessor considers all Volume Shadow Copies available on the
    system to deduplicate all files which are identical across all
    VSS. Only files that have been modified are shown.

    This makes it easier to compare files across VSS copies. If the
    file is the same across all VSS then the accessor prefers to show
    the one of the main device (i.e. `\\.\C:`)

    DelegateAccessor="data",
    DelegatePath="Hello world",

    -> "world"
    ```

    Runs query on result batches in parallel.

    Normally the source() plugin reads result sets from disk in
    series. This is fine when the result set is not too large but when
    we need to filter a lot of rows at the same time it is better to
    use all cores by reading and filtering in parallel.

    The `parallelize()` plugin is a parallel version of `source()`
    which breaks result sets into batches and applies a query over
    each batch in parallel. If you have a multi threaded machine, it
    will be a lot faster.

    The query passed to parallelize() will receive a special scope in
    which the `source()` plugin will returns results from a small
    batch of the total. The size of this batch is controlled by the
    `batch` parameter.

    This is especially useful when we need to filter rows from a hunt
    - each client's result set will be filtered in parallel on a
    different core.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM parallelize(hunt_id=HuntId, artifact=ArtifactName, query={
       SELECT * FROM source()
       WHERE FullPath =~ "XYZ"

    Parse a binary file into a data structure using a profile.

    This plugin extract binary data from strings. It works by applying
    a profile to the binary string and generating an object from
    that. Profiles are a json structure describing the binary format. For
    example a profile might be:

    ```json
    [
      ["StructName", 10, [
         ["field1", 2, "unsigned int"],
         ["field2", 6, "unsigned long long"],
       ]]]
    ]
    ```

    The profile is compiled and overlaid on top of the offset specified,
    then the object is emitted with its required fields.

    Please refer to [Binary
    Parsing](https://docs.velociraptor.app/docs/forensic/binary/) for
    a background in parsing binary data for forensic purposes and for
    instructions on how to construct profiles like the example above.

    More detailed information about profiles and their implementation
    can be found in the [vfilter](https://github.com/Velocidex/vtypes)
    module documentation.

    Parses events from a CSV file.

    Parses records from a CSV file. We expect the first row of the CSV
    file to contain column names.  This parser specifically supports
    Velociraptor's own CSV dialect and so it is perfect for post
    processing already existing CSV files.

    The types of each value in each column is deduced based on
    Velociraptor's standard encoding scheme. Therefore types are properly
    preserved when read from the CSV file.

    For example, downloading the results of a hunt in the GUI will produce
    a CSV file containing artifact rows collected from all clients.  We
    can then use the `parse_csv()` plugin to further filter the CSV file,
    or to stack using group by.

    ### Example

    The following stacks the result from a
    `Windows.Applications.Chrome.Extensions` artifact:

    ```vql
    SELECT count(items=User) As TotalUsers, Name
    FROM parse_csv(filename="All Windows.Applications.Chrome.Extensions.csv")
    Order By TotalUsers

    Parses events from an EVTX file.

    This plugin parses windows events from the Windows Event log files (EVTX).

    A windows event typically contains two columns. The `EventData`
    contains event specific structured data while the `System` column
    contains common data for all events - including the Event ID.

    You should probably almost always filter by one or more event ids
    (using the `System.EventID.Value` field).

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT System.TimeCreated.SystemTime as Timestamp,
           System.EventID.Value as EventID,
           EventData.ImagePath as ImagePath,
           EventData.ServiceName as ServiceName,

    Scan the $MFT from an NTFS volume.

    This plugin expect an $MFT file to operate on. For example, it is
    commonly used with the 'ntfs' accessor which opens the local raw
    device to provide access to the $MFT

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM parse_mft(filename="C:/$MFT", accessor="ntfs")
    ```

    For parsing from an image file, you can extract the $MFT file
    using the raw_ntfs accessor (which operates on images).

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM parse_mft(
         filename=pathspec(
           Path="$MFT",
           DelegateAccessor="file",

  description: |
    Parse specific inodes from an NTFS image file or the raw device.

    This function retrieves more information about a specific MFT
    entry including listing all its attributes.

    It can either operate on an image file or the raw device (on
    windows), or alternatively you can provide a raw $MFT file.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT parse_ntfs(
        filename='ntfs_image.dd',
        inode="46-128-0")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    You can get the MFT entry number from `parse_mft()` or from the
    Data attribute of a `glob()` using the `ntfs` accessor.

    ### Example - Using a raw $MFT file

    If you have previously collected the $MFT file (e.g. using the
    `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets` artifact, you can use `parse_ntfs()`
    to get more information about each MFT entry:

    ```vql
    SELECT EntryNumber, OSPath,
       parse_ntfs(mft_filename=MFTFile, mft=EntryNumber) AS Details
    FROM parse_mft(filename=MFTFile)
    ```

    Note that the raw $MFT file is sometimes not sufficient to
    reconstruct all attributes (for example if attributes are not
    stored in the $MFT but in external clusters).

  description: |
    Parses a file with a set of regexp and yields matches as records.  The
    file is read into a large buffer. Then each regular expression is
    applied to the buffer, and all matches are emitted as rows.

    The regular expressions are specified in the [Go
    syntax](https://golang.org/pkg/regexp/syntax/). They are expected to
    contain capture variables to name the matches extracted.

    For example, consider a HTML file with simple links. The regular
    expression might be:

    ```
    regex='<a.+?href="(?P<Link>[^"]+?)"'
    ```

    To produce rows with a column Link.

    The aim of this plugin is to split the file into records which can be
    further parsed. For example, if the file consists of multiple records,
    this plugin can be used to extract each record, while
    parse_string_with_regex() can be used to further split each record
    into elements. This works better than trying to write a more complex
    regex which tries to capture a lot of details in one pass.


    ### Example

    Here is an example of parsing the /var/lib/dpkg/status files. These
    files consist of records separated by empty lines:

  description: |
    Parse the USN journal from a device, image file or USN file.

    This plugin calculates the full path of a USN entry by tracing its
    parent MFT entries through the MFT file. The MFT can be found in
    the same device or image that the USN is read from, or provided
    separately using a different file.

    The plugin also considers information from the USN itself in
    resolving the full path. This technique is described here
    https://cybercx.com.au/blog/ntfs-usnjrnl-rewind/ in detail but it
    can result in more accurate path resolution when the directories
    have also been removed.

    Patch a JSON object with a json patch or merge.

    The function allows for modifications of objects by way of
    applying a json patch. You can read more about JSON patching here
    https://github.com/evanphx/json-patch.

    I practice you can use this to update server settings - for
    example, consider the client event monitoring state.

    ```vql
    SELECT get_client_monitoring() FROM scope()
    ```

    ```json
    [
      {
        "get_client_monitoring": {
          "artifacts": [
            "Generic.Client.Stats"
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    Suppose we wish to add a new artifact, we can patch it with the json:
    ```json
    [{"op": "add", "path": "/artifacts/0", "value": "Windows.Events.DNSQueries"}]
    ```

    This can then be immediately pushed to `set_client_monitoring()`
    to update the monitoring state.

    ```vql
    SELECT set_client_monitoring(value=patch(
           item=get_client_monitoring(),
           patch=[dict(op="add", path="/artifacts/0", value="Windows.Events.DNSQueries")]))
    FROM scope()

    Read from a VQL pipe.

    **NOTE: this is not the same as a windows named pipe**.

    A VQL pipe allows data to be generated from a VQL query, as the
    pipe is read, the query proceeds to feed more data to it.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    LET MyPipe = pipe(query={
            SELECT _value FROM range(start=0, end=10, step=1)
    }, sep="\n")

    SELECT read_file(filename="MyPipe", accessor="pipe")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    It is mostly useful for redirecting the output of one query to
    another without using temp files. You probably do not want to use
    it!

    A pipe allows plugins that use files to read data from a vql
    query.

    **NOTE: this is not the same as a windows named pipe**.

    This is needed to be able to use the "pipe" accessor.

    ### Example

    In the following example we create a pipe from a query which
    reads a log file line by line. Each line is being transformed by
    a regex and potentially filtered (perhaps to fix up buggy CSV
    implementations that generated a bad CSV).

    The pipe is then fed into the parse_csv() plugin to parse each
    line as a csv file.

    ```vql
    LET MyPipe = pipe(query={
        SELECT regex_replace(
          re='''^(\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}) (\d{2}:)''',
          replace='''${1}T${2}''', source=Line) AS Line
        FROM parse_lines(filename=IISPath)
        WHERE NOT Line =~ "^#"
      }, sep="\n")

    SELECT * FROM parse_csv(
       columns=Columns, separator=" ",

    Access process memory like a file.

    The Path is taken in the form `/<pid>`, i.e. the pid appears as
    the top level path component.

    The accessor does not support directories so it can not be used
    with the `glob()` plugin. It is useful for any functions or
    plugins that need to read from process memory.

    Note that process memory is typically very sparse (on 64 bit
    systems it covers the entire address space). Therefore,
    Velociraptor will treat it as sparse - various plugins that
    support sparse files (such as the `upload()` plugin or `yara()`
    plugin) will automatically handle the unmapped regions.

    You will therefore need other plugins like `vad()` to figure out
    the exact process memory layout where there is data to read. It is
    not an error to read from unmapped regions, but it will just
    return nulls.

  description: |
    Evaluate a VQL query.

    This plugin is useful for evaluating a query in a different
    environment or context, or turning a string into a query.

    The query provided by the `query` parameter can be a string, in
    which case it is parsed as a VQL expression, or a VQL expression.

    When we evaluate the query, it runs in an isolated scope. This
    means that usually variables defined outside the query plugin are
    not visible inside the query.

    You can use the `env` parameter to specify a dict of variables
    that will be visible inside the query. This allows to control how
    variables are shared between the new isolated scope and the
    existing scope outside the query.

    Below we describe a few quirks that users might encounter with
    this plugin.

    ### Custom artifacts

    The isolated scope does not contain any artifacts by
    default. Usually artifacts are accessible from VQL using the
    `Artifact` plugin, for example the following accesses the
    `Custom.VQL` artifact:

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM Artifact.Custom.VQL()
    ```

    This will not work in the query plugin because the scope is
    isolated. If you want to use the `Artifact` plugin in the new
    scope you need to pass it through the `env` variable:

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM query(query={
          SELECT * FROM Artifact.Custom.VQL()
    }, env=dict(artifact=Artifact))
    ```

    ### Remapping rules

    When using the `remap()` function to install a new remapping
    configuration, the remapping applies on the current scope and
    affect all further VQL statements after the `remap()` function is
    evaluated. This means that it is impossible to revoke the
    remapping configuration and restore the scope.

    For this reason we recommend that remapping rules be applied
    inside an isolated `query()` scope. This way the remapping will
    only apply for the like of the `query()` plugin invocation.

    ### Using LET statements inside the query

    The `query` parameter can specify a VQL statement or a string
    which will be parsed into a VQL statement. If you use a VQL
    statement it is no possible to use a LET expression (since LET is
    a separate statement). So this is not valid VQL syntax:

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM query(query={
      LET Foo(X) = ....
      SELECT * FROM Foo(X=1)
    })
    ```

    You can define the LET statements outside the query block and pass them in:
    ```vql
    LET Foo(X) = ....

    SELECT * FROM query(query={
      SELECT * FROM Foo(X=1)
    }, env=dict(Foo=Foo))
    ```

    Or declare the VQL block as a string;
    SELECT * FROM query(query='''
      LET Foo(X) = ....
      SELECT * FROM Foo(X=1)
    ''')
    ```

    ### Running a query in a different org

    Normally a VQL query runs in the org context in which it was
    started. However sometimes it is useful to run in different
    context. The `query()` plugin allows you to execute the query in
    another scope context created within a different org.

    To do this your user account must be sufficient permissions in the
    target org (The query will use the user's ACL permissions token
    for the target org).

    For example the following query lists all the clients from all orgs:

    ```vql
    SELECT *
    FROM foreach(row={
       SELECT OrgId
       FROM orgs()
    },  query={
       SELECT *, OrgId
       FROM query(query={ SELECT client_id FROM clients() }, org_id=OrgId)
    })
    ```

    ### Running as a different user

    You can specify a different user to run the VQL. This will load
    the other user's ACL token and username (basically this acts like
    the Linux `sudo` command).

    You need to have the IMPERSONATION ACL permission to be able to do
    this (Usually only admins have it). This permission is equivalent
    to administrator because a user with this permission can become
    any user they want including the administrator.

    Access the Ext4 filesystem inside an image by parsing the image.

    This accessor is designed to operate on images directly. It requires a
    delegate accessor to get the raw image and will open files using the
    FAT full path rooted at the top of the filesystem.

    ### Example

    The following query will glob all the files under the directory 'a'
    inside a Ext4 image file:

    ```vql
    SELECT *
    FROM glob(globs='/**',
      accessor="raw_ext4",
      root=pathspec(
        Path="a",
        DelegateAccessor="file",
        DelegatePath='ext4.dd'))
    ```

  description: |
    Access the filesystem using the OS API.

    This accessor allows to read raw devices. On Windows, raw files
    need to be read in aligned page size. This accessor ensures reads
    are buffered into page size buffers to make it safe for VQL to
    read the device in arbitrary alignment.

    We do not support directory operations on raw devices, so this
    accessor can not be used in the `glob()` plugin.

    Additionally this accessor does not attempt to interpret the
    device part of the path components. It will pass the full path
    string to the underlying OS APIs. This allows us to read arbitrary
    devices.

  - windows_amd64_cgo

  description: |
    Access the NTFS filesystem inside an image by parsing NTFS.

    This accessor is designed to operate on images directly. It requires a
    delegate accessor to get the raw image and will open files using the
    NTFS full path rooted at the top of the filesystem.

    ### Example

    The following query will open the $MFT file from the raw image file
    that will be accessed using the file accessor.

    ```vql
    SELECT * FROM parse_mft(
      filename=pathspec(
        Path="$MFT",
        DelegateAccessor="file",
        DelegatePath='ntfs.dd'),
      accessor="raw_ntfs")
    ```

    Note that this accessor is different than the standard `ntfs`
    accessor which attempts to emulate the simpler `file`
    accessor. This is so the paths can be easily interchanged between
    `file` and `ntfs`.

    The `ntfs` accessor automatically calculates the raw device needed
    to open the ntfs partition. The following queries are equivalent:

    ```
    SELECT * FROM parse_mft(
      filename=pathspec(
        Path="$MFT",
        DelegateAccessor="raw_file",
        DelegatePath='''\\.\C:'''),
      accessor="raw_ntfs")

    SELECT * FROM parse_mft(
      filename='''\\.\C:\$MFT''',
      accessor="ntfs")
    ```

    The `raw_ntfs` accessor is available in all supported platforms
    (i.e. not only Windows) and uses the same filesystem parser as the
    `ntfs` accessor. You can use this in conjunction with the
    `remap()` function to analyse raw NTFS volumes on any supported
    platform.

        root=pathspec(
          Path="ControlSet001",
          DelegateAccessor="auto",
          DelegatePath="C:/Windows/System32/config/System"))

    Present the content of a scope variable as a file.

    Similar to the `data` accessor, this makes a string appears as the
    file contents. However, instead of the filename itself containing
    the file content, the filename refers to the name of a variable in
    the current scope that contains the data.

    This is useful when the binary data is not unicode safe and can
    not be properly represented by JSON. Sometimes the filename is
    echoed in various log messages and with the `data` accessor this
    will echo some binary data into the logs.

    Access smb shares (e.g. Windows shares).

    This accessor is similar to the `s3` accessor in allowing access
    to remote network shares. The credentials are passed in a scope
    variable called `SMB_CREDENTIALS`. The credentials are a dict with
    the server name being the key and the username and password joined
    with ":".

    The first element in the path is treated as the server name (top
    level directory). The accessor then looks up the relevant
    credentials from the `SMB_CREDENTIALS` dict. This allows multiple
    servers and multiple credentials to be defined at the same time.

    ### Example

    ```
    LET SMB_CREDENTIALS <= dict(ServerName="Username:Password")

    SELECT OSPath,
    FROM glob(globs='*',
      root="/ServerName/Windows/System32",
      accessor="smb")

- name: sparse
  description: |
    Allows reading another file by overlaying a sparse map on top of
    it.

    The map excludes reading from certain areas which are considered
    sparse.

    The resulting file is sparse (and therefore uploading it excludes
    the masked out regions). The filename is taken as a list of
    ranges.

    For example here we create a sparse file over the delegate which only
    defines the first 5 bytes, then a 5 byte sparse region then another 5
    bytes.

    ```vql
    SELECT upload(accessor="sparse", path=pathspec(
      DelegateAccessor="data", DelegatePath=MyData,
      Path=[dict(Offset=0,Length=5), dict(Offset=10,Length=5)])
    FROM scope()
    ```

    The uploaded file will contain only 10 bytes but will retain the 5
    byte "hole" in the middle.

    This accessor is most useful when uploading or masking parts of other
    files - for example uploading a carved files from a larger image. NOTE
    that delegate offsets are retained in this accessor (so for example
    offset 10 in this accessor corresponds to offset 10 in the delegate
    regardless of the sparse map).

    For more flexibility than this use the "ranged" accessor.

    Access a remote system's filesystem via `SSH/SFTP`.

    This accessor allows accessing remote systems via `SFTP/SSH`.  This is
    useful for being able to search remote systems where it is not
    possible to run a Velociraptor client directly on the endpoint. For
    example, on embedded edge devices such as routers/firewalls/VPN
    servers etc.

    To use this accessor you will need to provide credentials via the
    SSH_CONFIG scope variable:

    ```vql
    LET SSH_CONFIG <= dict(hostname='localhost:22',
      username='mic',
      private_key=read_file(filename='/home/mic/.ssh/id_rsa'))

    SELECT OSPath FROM glob(accessor="ssh", globs="/*")
    ```

    NOTES:

    1. hostname must have a port after the column.
    2. You can provide a password instead of a private key via the
       password parameter to the `SSH_CONFIG`
    3. The private_key parameter must contain an unencrypted PEM encoded
       SSH private key pair.

    we need some small functions with more complex needs. We can use a
    more powerful language to create small functions to transform
    certain fields etc.

    ### Example

    In the following example we define a Starl code block and compile
    it into a module. VQL code can then reference any functions
    defined within it directly.

    ```vql
    LET MyCode <= starl(code='''
    load("math.star", "math")

    def Foo(X):
      return math.sin(X)

    ''')

    SELECT MyCode.Foo(X=32)
    FROM scope()
    ```

    Convert from different types to a time.Time.

    This is one of the most important functions in VQL. We need to
    convert timestamps very frequently from various
    representations. Most commonly from strings, Unix epoch times etc.

    This function is pretty smart and tries to do the right thing most
    of the time automatically. For example, you can provide the epoch
    parameter as an integer representing seconds since the epoch,
    milliseconds or microseconds since the epoch.

    ```vql
    SELECT timestamp(epoch=1630414425) AS Time1,
           timestamp(epoch=1630414425000) AS Time2,
           timestamp(epoch=1630414425000000) AS Time3,
    FROM scope()
    ```

    You can also provide a string, and `timestamp()` will try to parse
    it by guessing what it represents. For example:

    ```vql
    SELECT timestamp(string='March 3 2019'),
           timestamp(string='07/25/2019 5pm')
    FROM scope()
    ```

    For more control over the parsing of strings, use the `format`
    parameter to specify a template which will be used to parse the
    timestamp.

    The format template uses a constant time as an example of how the
    time is layed out. It represents a template for a timestamp that
    **must** use the following date constants

    * Year: "2006" "06"
    * Month: "Jan" "January"
    * Textual day of the week: "Mon" "Monday"
    * Numeric day of the month: "2" "_2" "02"
    * Numeric day of the year: "__2" "002"
    * Hour: "15" "3" "03" (PM or AM)
    * Minute: "4" "04"
    * Second: "5" "05"
    * AM/PM mark: "PM"
    * "-0700"  ±hhmm
    * "-07:00" ±hh:mm
    * "-07"    ±hh

    ```vql
    SELECT timestamp(string="8/30/2021 6:01:28 PM",
                     format="1/2/2006 3:04:05 PM")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    If the timestamp is ambiguous - i.e. does not specify a timezone
    you can provide a timezone hint using the `PARSE_TZ` VQL
    variable. This will only be used if the timestamp is ambiguous. If
    `PARSE_TZ` is `local` then we use the local timezone on the
    endpoint.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    LET PARSE_TZ <= "local"

    SELECT timestamp(string="Thu Aug 29 2024 21:03"),
           timestamp(string="Thu Aug 29 2024 21:03 CEST")
    FROM scope()
    ```

    The first timestamp will be parsed according to the local timezone
    because it is ambiguous. However, the second timestamp is not
    ambiguous and `PARSE_TZ` has no effect.

    Internally VQL uses Golang's
    [time.Time](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#Time) object to represent
    times and this is what is returned by the `timestamp()` VQL
    function. This object has a number of useful methods which are
    available via fields on the timestamp object:

    ```json
    {
      "Day": 26,
      "Hour": 8,
      "ISOWeek": 2024,
      "IsDST": "false",
      "IsZero": "false",
      "Minute": 53,
      "Month": 3,
      "Nanosecond": 231540468,
      "Second": 37,
      "String": "2024-03-26T06:53:37Z",
      "UTC": "2024-03-26T06:53:37.231540468Z",
      "Unix": 1711436017,
      "UnixMicro": 1711436017231540,
      "UnixMilli": 1711436017231,
      "UnixNano": 1711436017231540500,
      "Weekday": 2,
      "Year": 2024,
      "YearDay": 86,
      "Zone": "SAST"
    }
    ```

    For example `timestamp(epoch=now()).Month` is the current month.

    To perform time manipulations you can convert times back to the
    seconds from epoch, then add/subtract times. For example the
    following calculates the time exactly one day (24 hours) before
    the stated time:

    ```vql
    SELECT timestamp(epoch=timestamp(epoch="2024-03-26T06:53:37Z").Unix - 86400)

    Format a timestamp into a string.

    This uses the same type of format string as described

    constants described in https://pkg.go.dev/time#pkg-constants as a
    shorthand to common time formatting directives.

    The output timezone is UTC by default but can be changed using the
    `TZ` VQL variable.

  description: |
    Construct a dict from a query.

    Sometimes we need to build a dict object where both the names of
    the keys and their values are not known in advance - they are
    calculated from another query. In this case we can use the
    to_dict() function to build a dict from a query. The query needs
    to emits as many rows as needed with a column called `_key` and
    one called `_value`. The `to_dict()` will then construct a dict
    from this query.

    ### Notes

    1. In VQL all dicts are ordered, so the order in which rows appear
    in the query will determine the dict's key order.

    2. VQL dicts always have string keys, if the `_key` value is not a
    string the row will be ignored.

    ### Example

    The following (rather silly) example creates a dict mapping Pid to
    ProcessNames in order to cache Pid->Name lookups. We then resolve
    Pid to Name within other queries. Note the use of <= to
    materialize the dict into memory once.

    ```vql
    LET PidLookup <= to_dict(item={
        SELECT str(str=Pid) AS _key, Name AS _value
        FROM pslist()
    })

    SELECT Pid, get(item=PidLookup, field=str(str=Pid))

  description: |
    Construct a URL or parse one.

    This function parses or constructs URLs. A URL may be constructed from
    scratch by providing all the components or it may be parsed from an
    existing URL.

    The returned object is a [golang
    URL](https://golang.org/pkg/net/url/#URL) and can be serialized again
    using its `String` method.

    This function is important when constructing parameters for certain
    accessors which receive a URL. For example the `zip` accessor requires
    its file names to consist of URLs. The Zip accessor interprets the URL
    in the following way:

    - The scheme is the delegate accessor to use.
    - The path is the delegate accessor's filename
    - The fragment is used by the zip accessor to retrieve the zip member itself.

    In this case it is critical to properly escape each level - it is not
    possible in the general case to simply append strings. You need to use
    the `url()` function to build the proper url.

    Gets the version of a VQL plugin or function.

    This is useful when writing portable VQL which can work with
    older versions of Velociraptor. When Velociraptor plugins evolve
    in an incompatible way their version is incremented. It is
    possible to cater for multiple versions in the VQL using an if()
    plugin.

    For example the following can chose from a legacy query or a
    modern query based on the plugin version:

    ```vql
     SELECT * FROM if(
      condition=version(plugin="glob") >= 1,
      then=NewQuery,

    Access client's VFS filesystem on the server.

    On the Velociraptor server, the Virtual File System (VFS)
    represents a cached copy of the files and directories we have
    collected from the client using the `VFS` GUI.

    Since it is a snapshot formed over multiple collections from the
    GUI it may change in future (for example if a file is added or
    removed, the next time the directory is refreshed the VFS view
    will change).

    Due to the interactive nature of the VFS collections, the VFS is
    constructed over many collections in different times.

    Sometimes we want to directly read those cached files and
    directories and this is where the `vfs` accessor comes in.

    The accessor gets the client's ID from the `ClientId` scope
    variable. The first component of the path is taken to be the
    accessor (top level of the VFS GUI).

    This accessor is mostly used in the `System.VFS.Export` artifact
    to facilitate snapshotting of the VFS view in the GUI.

    Allow reading a VHDX file.

    This accessor allows access to the content of VHDX files. Note that usually
    VHDX files are disk images with a partition table and an NTFS volume. You
    will usually need to wrap this accessor with a suitable Offset (to account
    for the partition) and parse it with the the "raw_ntfs" accessor.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT OSPath.Path AS OSPath, Size, Mode.String
    FROM glob(
       globs="*", accessor="raw_ntfs", root=pathspec(
         Path="/",

    This accessor allows access to the content of VMDK files. Note

    an NTFS volume. You will usually need to wrap this accessor with a
    suitable Offset (to account for the partition) and parse it with
    the the "raw_ntfs" accessor.

    The VMDK file should be the metadata file (i.e. not the extent
    files).  The extent files are expected to be in the same directory
    as the metadata file and this accessor will open them separately.

    ### Example

    ```vql
    SELECT OSPath.Path AS OSPath, Size, Mode.String
    FROM glob(
      globs="*", accessor="raw_ntfs", root=pathspec(

    {{% notice note %}}

    It often takes several seconds for events to be flushed to the event
    log and so this plugin's event may be delayed. For some applications
    this results in a race condition with the event itself - for example,
    files mentioned in the event may already be removed by the time the
    event is triggered.

  description: |
    Uses the `winpmem` driver to take a memory image.

    This plugin is also needed to facilitate the winpmem accessor.

    When the `image_path` parameter is not set this function will load
    the `winpmem` driver until the scope is destroyed at the end of
    the query (where the driver will be unloaded).

    If the `image_path` parameter is give, the path will be used to
    create a raw memory image. The image can be compressed using a
    number of algorithms such as:

    1. None - no compression (default)

    2. S2 or snappy - these are fast algorithms with poor compression
       ratio but should result in some speed up over no compression.

    3. The Gzip method is used to produce a compatible gzip file. This
       is very slow and so it is not suitable for large memory systems
       as there will be too much smear.

    SELECT winpmem(image_path='c:/test.dd', compression='s2') FROM scope()"

    call these unsupported modules are mixed in with many other
    supported rules.

    This function lints the rules in a yara rule set and removes rules
    which are not supported. The function also automatically adds yara
    imports if they are used by any of the rules.

    Additionally, providing the clean parameter will also remove all
