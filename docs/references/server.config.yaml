    ## Clients may connect to servers which use a self-signed certificate.
    ## This list allows to specify a set of certificate thumbprints (SHA256)
    ## which are used to validate TLS server certificates.
    ##
    ## Fingerprints can be generated with the OpenSSL command line utility:
    ##   openssl s_client -connect www.google.com:443 < /dev/null | openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256 -noout
    ##
    ## Certificate thumbprints may or may not include colon characters. Capitalization
    ## of the hex digits is ignored by Velociraptor. A thumbprint of any of the
    ## forms used below (or combinations thereof) is fine.
    certificate_thumbprints:
      - "E6:E2:8B:35:CE:C5:BA:C4:53:C5:AF:BF:2B:76:34:62:40:5C:D0:60:80:E1:30:1A:A7:A5:A9:DA:0C:8B:11:E1"

    ## Velociraptor supports several ways of verifying TLS certificates. The
    ## certificate_verification_mode specifies which of the three modes is applied.
    ## Currently, three modes are available:
    ##
    ## PKI (the default):
    ##   verify TLS certs against public CA lists, the list of additional root_certs (see above),
    ##   and the built-in CA cert
    ##
    ## PKI_OR_THUMBPRINT:
    ##   the same as PKI with the addition that certificates which have a thumbprint that is
    ##   present in certificate_thumbprints will be accepted as well
    ##
    ## THUMBPRINT_ONLY:
    ##   Velociraptor only accepts certificates which have a matching thumbprint in
    ##   certificate_thumbprints. All other certificates will be rejected. This mode is
    ##   also known as certificate pinning.
    certificate_verification_mode: "PKI"

    ## By default velociraptor uses TLS 1.3 to secure it's
    ## communications. Some networks use a MITM TLS proxy which does
    ## not support more secure protocols so this setting can be
    ## applied to make the server allow lower TLS versions.
    allow_weak_tls_server: false


    ## If you want to use mTLS to mutually authenticate clients to the
    ## server, place a pem encoded client certificate here. This
    ## certificate will be presented to the server before a TLS
    ## connection can be made.
    ##
    ## This is an additional level of security that controls
    ## connections between clients and server. It is normally not
    ## needed as client connections are controlled via the embedded
    ## nonce. However mTLS authentication allows termination of the
    ## TLS before the server (e.g. using a reverse proxy).
    ##
    ## To configure this feature you can create a certificate signed
    ## by the Velociraptor CA:
    ## velociraptor --config server.config.yaml config api_client --name "Client" api.config.yaml
    ##
    ## This will create an api config file with the key pair encoded
    ## as PEM strings. You can then copy and paste those into the
    ## settings below. Only clients configured with these keys can
    ## talk with the server
    ##
    ## To require the frontend to only talk with mTLS authenticated
    ## clients, set the Frontend.require_client_certificates to true.
    client_certificate: "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- ..."
    client_certificate_private_key: "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY----- ..."

  ## A list of one or more URLs the clients will try to connect
  ## to. When all connections fail the client will back off for a
  ## while. Clients will choose one of these at random so it is a good
  ## way of achieving fault tolerance and load balancing.  As of
  ## version 0.72, You can choose to use websockets here for a better
  ## experience by setting the URL to start with wss://
  server_urls:
  - wss://192.168.1.1:8000/
  - https://192.168.1.1:8000/
  - https://192.168.1.2:8000/

  ## When using websockets the server will ping the client every this
  ## many seconds.
  ws_ping_wait_sec: 60

  ## A URL to a proxy that will be used to connect to the server. Some
  ## environments have egress filtering requiring Velociraptor to use
  ## a proxy to be able to reach the server. NOTE: We do not support
  ## PAC based proxy configurations or Windows domain authentication -
  ## you might need to add an allow rule to the proxy config to allow
  ## the Velociraptor server URL without authentication.
  proxy: https://proxy:3128/

  ## Some proxy configurations are more complex. You can specify a
