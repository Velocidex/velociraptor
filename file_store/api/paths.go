# How paths are handled in Velociraptor.

Velociraptor treats paths as a list of components. Each component is a
string which may contain arbitrary bytes - including path separators.

Ultimately these paths need to be encoded into a filesystem backend
which has many rules about the types of characters allowed on them. We
therefore need to apply conversions to make the general path fit in
the fileystem backend restrictions - this process is called
Sanitization.

For example consider a path like: ["a", "b/c"]

The path consists of two components, one of which happens to have a
path separator. Therefore in order to store it on the filesystem we
must sanitize the components and come up with a filesystem path like
this: "/a/b%2Ec/"

Velociraptor paths can come from many different sources but all
internal representations consist of a list of components. For example:

Client path -> paths.UnsafeDatastorePathFromClientPath() -> UnsafeDatastorePath()
path managers -> SafeDatastorePath()

## SafeDatastorePath vs. UnsafeDatastorePath

When encoding to the filesystem, a Velociraptor path needs to be
sanitized. There are some cases where we know this sanitization is not
needed. Namely when the path is created by a path manager and does not
contain user input. In this case we can take a shortcut - we do not
need to sanitize the data when we write the path in the backing
filesystem (because we have full control over the path components).

For example, consider the path to a client's datastore record:
["clients", client_id]

There is no need to escape anything especially here, since we know all
the components to be safe.

Consider this path from the client:
["clients", client_id, "vfs", "ntfs", "\\\\.\\c:\\", "Windows"]

This path might need to be escaped since it comes from the client
(specifically the device name). Therefore we construct an
UnsafeDatastorePath.

We can convert between an UnsafeDatastorePath to a SafeDatastorePath
by simply sanitizing all components.

This design strikes a balance between:

1. Avoids the need for any other code to worry about filestore
   encoding since encoding happens only at the file store -
   everything else just passes the raw component slice around.

2. Avoids the need to encode/decode paths that are fixed and safe
   such as paths created for internal use with already known safe
   names.

Ultimately the path managers determine which API is most appropriate
by either offering a safe or unsafe path spec
