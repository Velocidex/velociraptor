name: Windows.KapeFiles.Targets
description: |

    Kape is a popular bulk collector tool for triaging a system
    quickly. While KAPE itself is not an opensource tool, the logic it
    uses to decide which files to collect is encoded in YAML files
    hosted on the KapeFiles project
    (https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) and released under an
    MIT license.

    This artifact is automatically generated from these YAML files,
    contributed and maintained by the community. This artifact only
    encapsulates the KAPE "Targets" - basically a bunch of glob
    expressions used for collecting files on the endpoint. We do not
    do any post processing these files - we just collect them.

    We recommend that timeouts and upload limits be used
    conservatively with this artifact because we can upload really
    vast quantities of data very quickly.

parameters:
  - name: UseAutoAccessor
    description: |
      Uses file accessor when possible instead of ntfs parser - this
      is much faster. Note that when using VSS analysis we have to use
      the ntfs accessor for everything which will be much slower.
    type: bool
    default: Y

  - name: Device
    description: |
      Name of the drive letter to search. You can add multiple drives
      separated with a comma.
    default: "C:,D:"

  - name: VSSAnalysisAge
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      If larger than zero we analyze VSS within this many days
      ago. (e.g 7 will analyze all VSS within the last week).  Note
      that when using VSS analysis we have to use the ntfs accessor
      for everything which will be much slower.

        # Post process this collection.

        Uncomment the following and evaluate the cell to create new
        collections based on the files collected from this artifact.

        The below VQL will apply remapping so standard artifacts will
        see the KapeFiles.Targets collection below as a virtual
        Windows Client. The artifacts will be collected to a temporary
        container and then re-imported as new collections into this
        client.

        NOTE: This is only a stop gap in case the proper artifacts
        were not collected in the first place. Parsing artifacts
        through a remapped collection is not as accurate as parsing
        directly on the endpoint. See
        https://docs.velociraptor.app/training/playbooks/preservation/
        for more info.
