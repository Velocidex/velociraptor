description: |

    Kape is a popular bulk collector tool for triaging a system
    quickly. While KAPE itself is not an opensource tool, the logic it
    uses to decide which files to collect is encoded in YAML files
    hosted on the KapeFiles project
    (https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) and released under an
    MIT license.

    This artifact is automatically generated from these YAML files,
    contributed and maintained by the community. This artifact only
    encapsulates the KAPE "Targets" - basically a bunch of glob
    expressions used for collecting files on the endpoint. We do not
    do any post processing these files - we just collect them.

    We recommend that timeouts and upload limits be used
    conservatively with this artifact because we can upload really
    vast quantities of data very quickly.

parameters:
  - name: UseAutoAccessor
    description: Uses file accessor when possible instead of ntfs parser - this is much faster.
    type: bool
    default: Y
  - name: Device
    description: Name of the drive letter to search. You can add multiple drives separated with a comma.
    default: "C:,D:"
  - name: VSSAnalysis
    type: bool
    default:
    description: If set we run the collection across all VSS and collect only unique changes.

%(parameters)s
  - name: KapeRules
    type: hidden
    description: A CSV file controlling the different Kape Target Rules
    default: |
%(csv)s
  - name: KapeTargets
    type: hidden
    description: Each parameter above represents a group of rules to be triggered. This table specifies which rule IDs will be included when the parameter is checked.
    default: |
%(rules)s
  - name: DontBeLazy
    description: Normally we prefer to use lazy_ntfs for speed. Sometimes this might miss stuff so setting this will fallback to the regular ntfs accessor.
    type: bool

  - name: NTFS_CACHE_TIME
    type: int
    description: How often to flush the NTFS cache. (Default is never).
    default: "1000000"
