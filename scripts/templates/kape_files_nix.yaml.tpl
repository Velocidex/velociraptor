description: |

    Kape is a popular bulk collector tool for triaging a system
    quickly. While KAPE itself is not an opensource tool, the logic it
    uses to decide which files to collect is encoded in YAML files
    hosted on the KapeFiles project
    (https://github.com/EricZimmerman/KapeFiles) and released under an
    MIT license.

    This artifact is automatically generated from these YAML files,
    contributed and maintained by the community. This artifact only
    encapsulates the KAPE "Targets" - basically a bunch of glob
    expressions used for collecting files on the endpoint. We do not
    do any post processing these files - we just collect them.

    We recommend that timeouts and upload limits be used
    conservatively with this artifact because we can upload really
    vast quantities of data very quickly.
