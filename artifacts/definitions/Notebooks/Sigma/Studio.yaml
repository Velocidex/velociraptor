          This notebook is designed to help you write and test Sigma
          Rules for detection within Velociraptor!

          ## What is Sigma?

          Sigma is an open notation for writing detection rules - It
          is supported natively in Velociraptor as described in [our
          blog post](https://docs.velociraptor.app/blog/2024/2024-05-09-detection-engineering/)

          Sigma relies on a set of `Log Sources` (defining possible
          sources for log events) and `Field Mappings` (an agreed upon
          set of field transformations that may be referred to in the
          Sigma rule).

          The Sigma standard does not define those, but they are
          critical for successfully writing Sigma rules. Therefore,
          Velociraptor uses [a standard set of Log Sources and Field
          Mappings](https://sigma.velocidex.com/).

          This is the purpose of this notebook! Making it easy and
          simple to write rules **within the definitions of
          Velociraptor's curated sets**. This means that portability
          of rules to other systems is **not a goal** of this
          notebook.

          ## How to use this notebook?

          1. Before you start, collect the
             `Server.Import.CuratedSigma` artifact to download the
             latest `Sigma Profiles`. A `Sigma Profile` is a machine
             readable definition of log sources and field mappings
             that allows the GUI to guide rule authors.

          2. Collect event samples. Use the relevant `CaptureTestSet`
             artifact (e.g. `Windows.Sigma.Base.CaptureTestSet`) collect
             events from the relevant log source. You can post-process
             the rows and filter in the notebook as usual.

          3. When you are ready to work with a test set, click `export
             to JSON` in the GUI to receive a JSON file with the test
             data.

          4. Upload this test set into this notebook.

          5. Open the `Sigma Editor` within this notebook.

          6. Select the relevant log source from the drop down (you
             will only see supported log sources).

          7. Follow the instructions within the Sigma editor. You can
             name any of the supported fields inside the rule.

          8. Saving the rule will automatically apply the ruleset on
             the test set. This gives visual feedback of how effective
             the rule is.

          9. When you are ready to deploy at scale download the
             ruleset from the notebook and enter it to the base sigma
             artifact (e.g. `Windows.Sigma.Base`).


          After you are familiar with the `Sigma Studio` notebook you
          can delete this instructional cell.

          # Sample Events For testing.

          You can test the sigma rules on test events in JSONL
          format. Upload samples into this notebook by using the
          `Notebook Uploads` dialog.

          {{ define "Testing" }}
          // Feed all the json rows to the log sources.
          LET AllRows = SELECT * FROM foreach(row={
            SELECT vfs_path FROM uploads()
            WHERE vfs_path =~ 'attach.+json$'
          }, query={
            SELECT * FROM parse_jsonl(accessor='fs', filename=vfs_path)
          })

          LET TestingLogSourceDict <= to_dict(item={
            SELECT _key, AllRows AS _value
            FROM items(item=LogSources)
          })

          // Build the log sources automatically.
          LET TestingLogSources <= sigma_log_sources(`**`=TestingLogSourceDict)

          // Apply the Sigma Rules on the samples.

            field_mapping= FieldMapping)

          {{ end }}

          ## Match rules on test set

          {{ if ( Scope "Debug" ) }}
          Debug mode is enabled, so all events will be shown. Inspect
          the Match object to see which detections matched.
          {{ else }}
          Debug mode is disabled, so only matching events will be shown. Enable Debug mode by editing the notebook.
          {{ end }}
