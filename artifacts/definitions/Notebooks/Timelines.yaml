  The notebook creates a default Super-Timeline.

  Timelines are used to visualize time series data from other
  collections in the same place. This notebook template creates an
  initial timeline.

  Once this timeline is created, you can add any time series table in
  other notebooks (e.g. Collection or Hunt notebooks) to this super
  timeline.
