  This is a demo of the fifo() plugin. The Fifo plugin collects and
  caches rows from its inner query. Every subsequent execution of the
  query then reads from the cache. The plugin will expire old rows
  depending on its expiration policy - so we always see recent rows.

  You can use this to build queries which consider historical events
  together with current events at the same time. In this example, we
  check for a successful logon preceded by several failed logon
  attempts.

  In this example, we use the clock() plugin to simulate events. We
  simulate failed logon attempts by using the clock() plugin every
  second. By feeding the failed logon events to the fifo() plugin we
  ensure the fifo() plugin cache contains the last 5 failed logon
  events.

  We simulate a successful logon event every 3 seconds, again by using
  the clock plugin. Once a successful logon event is detected, we go
  back over the last 5 login events, count them and collect the last
  failed logon times (using the GROUP BY operator we group the
  FailedTime for every unique SuccessTime).

  If we receive more than 3 events, we emit the row.

  This now represents a high value signal! It will only occur when a
  successful logon event is preceded by at least 3 failed logon
  events in the last hour. It is now possible to escalate this on the
  server via email or other alerts.

  Here is sample output:

  .. code-block:: json

      {
        "Count": 5,
        "FailedTime": [
          1549527272,
          1549527273,
          1549527274,
          1549527275,
          1549527276
        ],
        "SuccessTime": 1549527277
      }

  Of course in the real artifact we would want to include more
  information than just times (i.e. who logged on to where etc).
