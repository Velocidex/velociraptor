  Automates the analysis of dead disk images in Velociraptor

  Velociraptor can analyze dead disk images by using accessor
  remapping. The process involves detecting a suitable remapping
  configuration to remap various image partitions into the relevant
  accessors and emulate a "Virtual Host".

  Once the remapping configuration is calculated, a new virtual
  client can be launched to appear like it is operating on the dead
  disk image. Using this technique is it possible to interact with
  this virtual client, collect artifacts, join in hunts etc.

  This artifact automates this process. While the artifact is running,
  the virtual client will be up. To kill the virtual client you can
  cancel this collection. By default the artifact will remain running
  for 1 hour but you can extend the time limit while launching the
  artifact using the resources tab.

parameters:
- name: ImagePath
  default: /path/to/image.vmdk
  description: |
    This is the path to the image (.vmdk, .vhdx etc) which must reside on the server.

  default: DeadDiskHost
  description: The virtual host to provide to the client

- name: WritebackFile
  default: /tmp/remapping.writeback.yaml
  description: |
    Where to store the writeback file. This contains the client ID and
    should persist between invocations.
