name: Server.Utils.CancelHunt
description: |
  Sometimes a hunt is issued which is no longer useful. While stopping
  the hunt from the GUI prevents new clients from receiving the hunt,
  it does not actively cancel collections currently in flight.

  This artifact enumerates all flows in the hunt and actively cancels
  them.
