description: |
  The Velociraptor offline collector is an automated, preconfigured
  collection tool. Users can use the collector to automatically
  collect any artifacts on endpoints that do not have the Velociraptor
  client (offline endpoints).

  The collector creates a ZIP archive with the results of the
  collection in JSON files (and any uploaded files).

  This artifact allows for these offline collections to be imported
  back into the Velociraptor GUI. The collected data can then treated
  exactly the same as if it was collected by the regular Velociraptor
  client (i.e. post-processed through the notebook interface), except
  it was collected via the Sneakernet.

  NOTE: This artifact reads the collection ZIP from the server's
  filesystem. It is up to you to arrange for the file to be stored on
  the server (e.g. SCP it over).

  NOTE: This artifact is still experimental - please provide feedback
  on our issue board.
