name: Server.Utils.DeleteManyFlows
description: |
   Sometimes the Velociraptor server accumulates a lot of data that is
   no longer needed.

   This artifact will enumerate all flows from all clients and matches
   them against some criteria. Flows that match are then removed.

   **NOTE** This artifact will destroy all data irrevocably. Take
     care! You should always do a dry run first to see which flows
     will match before using the ReallyDoIt option.
