name: Server.Utils.UpdatePublicHashes
description: |
  The server maintains a public directory which can be served to all
  endpoints. The public directory should be initially populated by
  running the Server.Utils.DownloadBinaries artifact. It is possible
  to manually edit the content of this directory but you will need to
  update the hashes.

  Clients maintain their local cache of the files and they use the
  hash to tell if their local copy is out of date.

  This artifact will regenerate the inventory file by re-calculating
  the hashes of all files in the public directory.

  You need to run this artifact on the server if you manually edit the
  content of the public directory.
