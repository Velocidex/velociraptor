name: Server.Utils.BackupS3
description: |
   This server monitoring artifact will automatically zip and backup
   any collected artifacts to s3.

   You will need to provide credentials to upload to the bucket. The
   credentials can be given as parameters or they will be taken from
   the server metadata (as DefaultBucket, DefaultRegion,
   S3AccessKeyId, S3AccessSecret, S3AccessToken)

   Thanks to @shortxstack and @Recon_InfoSec
