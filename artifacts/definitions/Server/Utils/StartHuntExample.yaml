description: |
  This example artifact shows how to create a utility artifact to
  provide low privileged users with a controlled ability to perform
  high privileged operations.

  This server artifact launches a new `Generic.Client.Info` hunt, but
  the parameters for the hunt are not determined by the initiating
  user. This makes is safe for unprivileged users to schedule this
  hunt whenever they want.

  Usually to start a hunt, the user must have the `START_HUNT`
  permission - usually granted by the `administrator` or
  `investigator` roles. Additionally, to collect this
  artifact, a user must have the `COLLECT_SERVER` permission - usually
  only granted by the `administrator` role.

  So by default this artifact does not give any additional permissions
  and usually has to be collected by an `administrator` (which would
  be able to schedule hunts anyway).

  However, it is possible to mark the artifact as basic by using the VQL

  ```vql
  SELECT artifact_set_metadata(
      artifact="Server.Utils.StartHuntExample", basic=TRUE)
  FROM scope()
  ```

  This will allow users with the `COLLECT_BASIC` permission to also
  collect it. Once collected the artifact specifies the impersonate
  field to `admin` which will cause it to run under the `admin` user's
  permissions.

  This combination allows us to now grant the `COLLECT_BASIC`
  permission to any user and they will be able to start the hunt via
  this artifact, but have no additional permissions to start arbitrary
  hunts or collections.
