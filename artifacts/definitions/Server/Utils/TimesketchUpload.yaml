  Timesketch is an interactive collaborative timeline analysis tool
  that can be found at https://timesketch.org/

  This artifact uploads Velociraptor's timelines to Timesketch using
  the Timesketch client library. The artifact assumes the client
  library is installed and configured on the server.

  To install the Timesketch client library:
  ```
  pip install timesketch-import-client timesketch-cli-client
  ```

  To configure the client library to access your Timesketch instance
  see instructions https://timesketch.org/guides/user/cli-client/ and
  https://timesketch.org/guides/user/upload-data/

  This artifact assumes that the Timesketch CLI is preconfigured with
  the correct credentials in the `.timesketchrc` file.
