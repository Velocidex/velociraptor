name: Server.Utils.DeleteMonitoringData
description: |
   Velociraptor collects monitoring data from endpoints all the time.

   Sometimes this data is no longer needed and we might want to free
   up disk space.

   This artifact searches the monitoring data for each client and
   optionally removes data older than the specified timestamp.

   **NOTE** This artifact will destroy all data irrevocably. Take
     care! You should always do a dry run first to see which flows
     will match before using the `ReallyDoIt` option.

   - name: DateBefore
