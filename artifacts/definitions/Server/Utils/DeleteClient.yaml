name: Server.Utils.DeleteClient
description: |
  This artifact completely removes a client from the data store.

  Be careful with this one: there is no way to recover old
  data. However, if the client still exists, it will just
  automatically re-enroll when it next connects. You will still be able
  to talk to it, it is just that old collected data is deleted.

type: SERVER

parameters:
  - name: ClientIdList
    description: A list of client ids to delete.
    default:

  - name: ReallyDoIt
    description: If you really want to delete the client, check this.

      WHERE log(message="Deleting client " + ClientId)
