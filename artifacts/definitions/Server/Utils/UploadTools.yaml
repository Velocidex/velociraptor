name: Server.Utils.UploadTools
description: |
  Velociraptor can use external tools to deploy binaries on the
  endpoint for some artifacts that require it. Usually these binaries
  are automatically downloaded by the server when required. However,
  sometimes a server is deployed on an air-gapped network, or has
  egress filtering implemented such that the server is unable to
  download binaries on demand.

  In these cases it is useful to automatically pre-populate tools into
  a server manually. This artifact simplifies the process.

  1. The artifact produces a curl based script that helps to download
     required binaries on an internet connect system.

  2. When binaries are placed on a directory in the server's
     filesystem, the artifact can then be used to automatically upload
     the binaries as tools to the server.

  NOTE that in Velociraptor each org is completely separated, so you
  will need to re-upload the binaries when you create each org.
