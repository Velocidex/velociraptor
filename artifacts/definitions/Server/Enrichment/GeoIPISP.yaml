  Look up geo-information for an IP address using the MaxMind "GeoIP ISP"
  database.

  You can obtain a free-to-use (gratis but not libre) database from
  https://www.maxmind.com/ or you can pay for a more accurate option.

  You will need to provide the path to a valid GeoIP ISP database located on
  your server. The artifact expects you to store the database location in the
  server metadata, under the metadata key "GeoIPISPDB" (for example
  `/usr/shared/GeoIP2-City_20210910/GeoIP2-ISP.mmdb`).

  Although you can collect this artifact directly, it is more likely that you
  would import this artifact from your own artifact to gain access to the
  utility lookup functions.

export: |
  LET ISPDB = server_metadata().GeoIPISPDB
  LET ISP(IP) = geoip(db=ISPDB, ip=IP).isp
  LET ORG(IP) = geoip(db=ISPDB, ip=IP).organization
  LET ASN(IP) = geoip(db=ISPDB, ip=IP).autonomous_system_number
  LET ASO(IP) = geoip(db=ISPDB, ip=IP).autonomous_system_organization

parameters:
  - name: IP
