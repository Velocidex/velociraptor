name: Server.Orgs.NewOrg
description: |
  This server artifact will create a new org and assign the current user as an
  admin to it.

  NOTE: This artifact is only available to users with the `ORG_ADMIN`
  permission, which is normally only granted to users with the administrator
  role within the root org (that means you might need to switch to the root org
  in the GUI before collecting this artifact).

  This artifact will also run a set of server artifacts in the new org. If you
  need to run any other initialization steps in the new org, you can package
  those into one or more server artifacts and include those in the
  `InitialArtifacts` parameter.
