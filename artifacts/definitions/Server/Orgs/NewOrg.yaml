name: Server.Orgs.NewOrg
description: |
  This server artifact will create a new org and assign the current
  user as an admin to it.

  NOTE: This artifact is only available to users with the ORG_ADMIN
  permission, normally only given to users with the administrator role
  while using the root org (You might need to switch to the root org
  in the GUI before collecting this artifact).

  This artifact will also start a set of server artifacts in the new
  org. If you need to run any initialization steps in the new org,
  simple package those into a server artifact and include it in the
  `InitialArtifacts` parameter.
