name: Server.Import.ArtifactExchange
description: |
   This artifact will automatically import the latest artifact
   exchange bundle into the current server.

   ## Security note

   The artifact exchange is not officially supported by the
   Velociraptor team and contains contributions from the
   community. The quality, security and stability of artifacts from
   the exchange is not guaranteed. Some artifacts from the exchange
   will fetch external binaries and run them on your endpoints! These
   binaries are not reviewed or endorsed by the Velociraptor team or
   Rapid7!

   Contributions to the exchange must meet a lower quality bar than
   built in artifacts (for example lacking tests), which means that
   they may break at any time or not work as described!

   Collecting any of the artifacts in the exchange is purely at your
   own risk!.

   We strongly suggest users review exchange artifacts carefully
   before deploying them on their network!
