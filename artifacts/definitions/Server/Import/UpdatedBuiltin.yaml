name: Server.Import.UpdatedBuiltin
description: |
  This artifact allows importing updated versions of certain built-in artifacts.

  Currently these artifacts can be updated:

  - `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets`
  - `Generic.Forensic.SQLiteHunter`

  If you do not want to wait for the next full release, which will include any
  recent updates to these artifacts, then you can use this artifact to import
  the updated artifact version which may include features or improvements.

  NOTE: There are no guarantees that the updated artifacts will work on
  older Velociraptor versions. Ensure that you test thoroughly before deploying
  widely to clients.
