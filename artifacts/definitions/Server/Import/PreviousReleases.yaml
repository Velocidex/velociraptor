  When upgrading the Velociraptor server the built in artifacts may
  change using newer VQL features that are not present on older
  clients.

  If you have some older clients that can not be upgraded, sometimes
  collecting standard built-in artifacts will fail. In this case it is
  handy to import older VQL artifacts that work with these older
  clients.

  This server artifact allows you to automatically import all
  artifacts that came bundled with previous versions. These should be
  compatible with older clients.
