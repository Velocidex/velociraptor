  When upgrading the Velociraptor server, the built-in artifacts may change and
  use newer VQL features that are not present in older clients.

  If you have some older clients that cannot be upgraded, sometimes collection
  of updated built-in artifacts will fail due to incompatibility. In such
  situations it is necessary to import older VQL artifacts that will work with
  these older clients.

  This server artifact allows you to automatically import all artifacts that
  came bundled with previous versions. These should be compatible with older
  clients, but may lack newer features and improvements that the latest
  artifacts have.
