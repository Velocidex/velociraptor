  This is the welcome screen in the Velociraptor GUI. You can
  customize this screen by editing this artifact.

  When editing the artifact in the main `View Artifacts` screen you
  will see some markdown in the reports section of the YAML
  file. Simply edit this markdown and your server will display your
  customized report.

  You can use this to add important information to your specific
  deployment.
