name: Server.Hunts.AddFlow
description: |
  This artifact adds an existing flow to a running hunt.

  This helps in the case where the original flow in the hunt timed
  out. The user then can re-run the hunt manually possibly increasing
  timeout. Then they can simply click the add flow to hunt button in
  the UI to add the flow to an existing time.
