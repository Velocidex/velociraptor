description: |
  Forces conflicting clients to rekey themselves.

  Sometimes the Velociraptor client is installed into a VM template image with
  an existing writeback file. In this case each cloned instance will start the
  client with the same client id. When multiple clients attempt to
  simultaneously connect to the server with the same client id, the server will
  reject them with the HTTP "409 Rejected" response.

  This artifact detects such conflicts and instructs the affected clients to
  generate a new client id (saving their new keys into their writeback files)
  and then reconnect with the server.
