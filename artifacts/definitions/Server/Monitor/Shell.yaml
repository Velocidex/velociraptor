   Velociraptor can get an interactive shell on the endpoint by using
   the shell command. To use it, the user must be directly
   logged on the server.

   Obviously being able to run arbitrary commands on the end point is
   a powerful feature and should be used sparingly. There is an audit
   trail for shell commands executed and their output available by
   streaming all shell commands to the "Shell" client event monitoring
   artifact.

   This server event artifact centralizes all shell access from all
   clients into the same log file.
