name: Server.Monitor.Profile
description: |
  This artifact collects profiling information from the running
  server. This is useful when you notice a high CPU load in the server
  and want to know why.

  The following options are most useful:

  1. Goroutines: This shows the backtraces of all currently running
     goroutines. It will generally show most of the code working in the
     current running set of queries.

  2. Heap: This shows all allocations currently in use and where they
     are allocated from. This is useful if the server is taking too
     much memory.

  3. Profile: This takes a CPU profile of the running process for the
     number of seconds specified in the Duration parameter. You can
     read profiles using:

  ```
  go tool pprof -callgrind -output=profile.grind profile.bin
  kcachegrind profile.grind
  ```
