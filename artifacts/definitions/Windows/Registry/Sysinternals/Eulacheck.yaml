name: Windows.Registry.Sysinternals.Eulacheck
description: |
  Checks for the Accepted Sysinternals EULA from the registry key
  "HKCU\Software\Sysinternals\[TOOL]\".  When a Sysinternals tool is
  first run on a system, the EULA must be accepted. This writes a
  value called EulaAccepted under that key.

  Note: This artifact uses HKEY_USERS and therefore will not detect
  users that are not currently logged on.

   - name: Sysinternals_Reg_Key
