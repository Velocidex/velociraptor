  This artifact parses AppCompatCache (shimcache) from target hives. 
  
  AppCompatCache, also known as Shimcache, is a component of the Application 
  Compatibility Database, which was created by Microsoft and used by the Windows 
  operating system to identify application compatibility issues. This helps 
  developers troubleshoot legacy functions and contains data related to Windows 
  features.
  
  Note: the appcompatcache plugin does not currently support execution flag in 
  Windows 7 and 8/8.1 Systems.
