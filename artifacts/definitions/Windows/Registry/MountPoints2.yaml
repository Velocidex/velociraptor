name: Windows.Registry.MountPoints2
description: |
    This detection will collect any items in the MountPoints2 registry key.
    With a "$" in the share path. This key will store all remotely mapped
    drives unless removed so is a great hunt for simple admin $ mapping based
    lateral movement.
