name: Windows.Registry.WDigest
description: |
    Find WDigest registry values on the filesystem.

    In order to prevent the “clear-text” password from being placed in LSASS, the following registry key needs to be set to “0” (Digest Disabled):

     - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest “UseLogonCredential”(DWORD)

    This registry key is worth monitoring in an environment as an attacker may wish to set it to 1 to enable Digest password support which forces “clear-text” passwords to be placed in LSASS on any version of Windows from Windows 7 / 2008R2 up to Windows 10 / 2012R2. Furthermore, Windows 8.1 / 2012 R2 and newer do not have a “UseLogonCredential” DWORD value, so the key needs to be added. The existence of the key is suspicious, if not expected.
