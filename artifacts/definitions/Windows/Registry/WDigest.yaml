    Find WDigest registry values on the filesystem. The artifact will also use
    GROUP BY to limit all ControlSet output to a single row.

    In order to prevent a clear-text password from being placed in
    LSASS, the following registry key needs to be set to “0” (Digest
    Disabled):

     - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\WDigest
        “UseLogonCredential”(DWORD)
        “Negotiate”(DWORD)

    These registry keys are worth monitoring in an environment as an
    attacker may wish to set it to 1 to enable Digest password support
    which forces “clear-text” passwords to be placed in LSASS on any
    version of Windows from Windows 7 / 2008R2 up to Windows 10 /
    2012R2. Furthermore, Windows 8.1 / 2012 R2 and newer do not have a
    “UseLogonCredential” DWORD value, so the key needs to be
    added. The existence of the key is suspicious, if not expected.
