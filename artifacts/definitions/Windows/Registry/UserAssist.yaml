name: Windows.Registry.UserAssist
description: |
  Windows systems maintain a set of keys in the registry database
  (UserAssist keys) to keep track of programs that executed. The
  number of executions and last execution date and time are available
  in these keys.

  The information within the binary UserAssist values contains only
  statistical data on the applications launched by the user via
  Windows Explorer. Programs launched via the commandÂ­line (cmd.exe)
  do not appear in these registry keys.
  
  Additional data not parsed by Velociraptor is the FocusTime and FocusCount however these are not reliable.

  From a forensics perspective, being able to decode this information
  can be very useful.
