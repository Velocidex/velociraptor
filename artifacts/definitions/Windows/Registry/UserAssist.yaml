name: Windows.Registry.UserAssist
description: |
  Windows systems maintain a set of keys in the registry database
  (UserAssist keys) to keep track of programs that executed. The
  number of executions and last execution date and time are available
  in these keys.

  The information within the binary UserAssist values contains only
  statistical data on the applications launched by the user via
  Windows Explorer. Programs launched via the commandÂ­line (cmd.exe)
  do not appear in these registry keys.

  From a forensics perspective, being able to decode this information
  can be very useful.

  Limitations: Additional data not parsed by Velociraptor is the FocusTime
  and FocusCount however these are not reliable.
  Also please note that some methods of viewing an executable will update
  the associated UserAssist key, and some methods of accessing an executable
  will not update the execution counter or time. Therefore there may be
  some executions that have a 0 time and 0 runcount.
