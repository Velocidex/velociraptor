name: Windows.Registry.NTUser.Upload
description: |
  This artifact collects all the user's NTUser.dat registry hives.

  When a user logs into a windows machine the system creates their own
  "profile" which consists of a registry hive mapped into the
  HKEY_USERS hive. This hive file is locked while the user is
  logged in.

  This artifact bypasses the locking mechanism by extracting the
  registry hives using raw NTFS parsing. We then just upload all hives
  to the server.
