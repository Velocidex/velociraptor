name: Windows.Registry.EnableUnsafeClientMailRules
description: |
  Checks for Outlook EnableUnsafeClientMailRules = 1 (turned on).
  This registry key enables execution from Outlook inbox rules which can be used as a persistence mechanism.
  Microsoft has released a patch to disable execution but attackers can reenable by changing this value to 1.

  HKEY_USERS\*\Software\Microsoft\Office\*\Outlook\Security\EnableUnsafeClientMailRules = 0 (expected)
