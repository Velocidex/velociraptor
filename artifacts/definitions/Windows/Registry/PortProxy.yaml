    **Description**: 
    This artifact will return any items in the Windows PortProxy service 
    registry path. The most common configuration of this service is via the
    lolbin netsh.exe; Metaspoit and other common attack tools also have 
    configuration modules.

    **ATT&CK**: [T1090 - Connection Proxy](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1090/)  
    Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between
    systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command 
    and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.
