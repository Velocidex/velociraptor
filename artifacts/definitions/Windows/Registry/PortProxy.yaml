    This artifact will return any items in the Windows PortProxy service
    registry path. The most common configuration of this service is via the
    LOLBin `netsh.exe`. Metaspoit and other common attack tools also have
    configuration modules.

    Adversaries may use a connection proxy to direct network traffic between
    systems or act as an intermediary for network communications to a command
    and control server to avoid direct connections to their infrastructure.
