    This artifact enables querying Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

    Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) is the Microsoft implementation of
    Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM), which is an industry initiative to
    develop a standard technology for accessing management information in an
    enterprise environment. WMI uses the Common Information Model (CIM) industry
    standard to represent systems, applications, networks, devices, and other
    managed components. CIM is developed and maintained by the Distributed
    Management Task Force (DMTF).

    Please see the second reference link for an example of built in system classes.
