  The Windows task scheduler is a common mechanism that malware uses
  for persistence. It can be used to run arbitrary programs at a later
  time. Commonly malware installs a scheduled task to run itself
  periodically to achieve persistence.

  This artifact enumerates all the task jobs (which are XML
  files). The artifact uploads the original XML files and then
  analyses them to provide an overview of the commands executed and
  the user under which they will be run.

parameters:
  - name: TasksPath
    default: C:/Windows/System32/Tasks/**
  - name: AlsoUpload
    type: bool

      If set we also upload the task XML files.
  - name: UploadCommands
    type: bool
    description: |
      If set we attempt to upload the commands that are
      mentioned in the scheduled tasks
  - name: Username
