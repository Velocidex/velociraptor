  This artifact enables enumeration of process memory sections via the Virtual
  Address Descriptor (VAD). The VAD is used by the Windows memory manager to
  describe allocated process memory ranges.

  Available filters include process, mapping path, memory permissions
  or by content with yara.

  Use the UploadSection switch to upload any sections.

  A notebook suggestion is available for Strings analysis on uploaded sections.

  NOTE:

  - ProtectionChoice is a choice to filter on section protection. Default is
  all sections and ProtectionRegex can override selection.
  - To filter on unmapped sections the MappingNameRegex: ^$ can be used.
  - When uploading sections during analysis, its recommended to run once for
  scoping, then a second time once confirmed for upload.
