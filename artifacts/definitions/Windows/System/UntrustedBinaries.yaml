name: Windows.System.UntrustedBinaries
description: |
  Windows runs several services and binaries as part of the
  operating system. Sometimes malware pretends to run as those well
  known names to hide itself in plain sight. For example, a
  malware service might call itself svchost.exe so it shows up in the
  process listing as a benign service.

  This artifact checks that the common systems binaries are
  signed. If a malware replaces these files or names itself in this
  way their signature might not be correct.

  Note that unfortunately Microsoft does not sign all their common
  binaries so many will not be signed (e.g. conhost.exe).
