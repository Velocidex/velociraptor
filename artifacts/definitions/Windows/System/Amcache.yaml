  Get information from the system's amcache.

  The Amcache.hve file is a registry file that stores the information
  of executed applications. Amcache.hve records the recent processes
  that were run and lists the path of the files thatâ€™s executed which
  can then be used to find the executed program.

  This artifact works on Windows 10 1607 version.

      {{ .Description }}

      ## Execution clusters

      The AMCache artifact only shows us the time of first execution
      of a binary. We get an idea when it was installed. Typically
      execution artifacts are clustered in time - if an attacker
      copies a bunch of new tools they will all start running at about
      the same time.

      The below timeline shows a summary of execution clusters. The
      binaries are grouped in an hour interval. The label is the first
      binary name and the total number of binaries within that hour.

      > For clarity we hide the names of all other binaries, and just
        show the total count.

      {{ Query "recent_executions" "timeline" | Timeline }}


      Here is the same data in tabular form.

      {{ Query "timeline" | Table }}
