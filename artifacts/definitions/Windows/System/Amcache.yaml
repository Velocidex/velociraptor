  Get information from the system's amcache.

  The Amcache.hve file is a registry file that stores the information
  of executed applications. Amcache.hve records the recent processes
  that were run and lists the path of the files that’s executed which
  can then be used to find the executed program.

  This artifact works on Windows 10 1607 version.

      ## Execution clusters

      The AMCache artifact only shows us the time of first execution
      of a binary. We get an idea when it was installed. Typically
      execution artifacts are clustered in time - if an attacker
      copies a bunch of new tools they will all start running at about
      the same time.

      The below timeline shows a summary of execution clusters. The
      binaries are grouped in an hour interval. The label is the first
      binary name and the total number of binaries within that hour.

      > For clarity we hide the names of all other binaries, and just
        show the total count.

      {{ Query "recent_executions" "timeline" | Timeline }}


      Here is the same data in tabular form.

      {{ Query "timeline" | Table }}
