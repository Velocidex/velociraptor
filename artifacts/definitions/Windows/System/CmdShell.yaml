name: Windows.System.CmdShell
description: |
  This artifact allows running arbitrary commands through the system
  shell cmd.exe.

  Since Velociraptor typically runs as system, the commands will also
  run as System.

  This is a very powerful artifact since it allows for arbitrary
  command execution on the endpoints. Therefore this artifact requires
  elevated permissions (specifically the `EXECVE`
  permission). Typically it is only available with the `administrator`
  role.

required_permissions:
  - EXECVE

precondition:
  SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

parameters:
  - name: Command
    default: "dir C:\\"

sources:
  - query: |
      SELECT * FROM execve(argv=["cmd.exe", "/c", Command])
