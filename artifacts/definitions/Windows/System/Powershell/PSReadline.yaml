  This Artifact will search and extract lines from PSReadline history file.

  Powershell is commonly used by attackers across all stages of the attack
  lifecycle. The PSReadline module is responsible for command history and from
  Powershell 5 on Windows 10 default configuration saves a copy of the console
  history to disk.

  There are several parameter's available for search leveraging regex.
  - SearchStrings enables regex search over a PSReadline line.
  - StringWhiteList enables a regex whitelist for results.
  - UserRegex enables a regex search on Username
  - UploadFiles enables upload ConsoleHost_history.txt in scope
