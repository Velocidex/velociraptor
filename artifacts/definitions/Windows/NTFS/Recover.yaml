name: Windows.NTFS.Recover
description: |
  Attempt to recover deleted files.

  This artifact uploads all streams from an MFTId. If the MFT entry is not
  allocated there is a chance that the cluster that contains the actual data of
  the file will still be intact on the disk. Therefore it may be possible to
  recover such deleted files, which is what this artifact attempts to do.

  A common use is to recover deleted directory entries using the
  `Windows.NTFS.I30` artifact to identify MFT entries of interest. This artifact
  can then be used to attempt recovery of the file data.

parameters:
 - name: MFTId
   default: "81978"
 - name: Drive
   default: '\\.\C:'

precondition:
  SELECT * FROM info() where OS = 'windows'

sources:
  - name: Upload
    query: |
       LET Parsed <= parse_ntfs(device=Drive, inode=MFTId)

       SELECT *, upload(accessor="mft", file=Drive + Inode,
                        name=Parsed.OSPath + Inode) AS IndexUpload
       FROM foreach(
            row=Parsed.Attributes,
            query={
              SELECT _value.Type AS Type,
                     _value.TypeId AS TypeId,
                     _value.Id AS Id,
                     _value.Inode AS Inode,
                     _value.Size AS Size,
                     _value.Name AS Name
              FROM scope()
            })
