  Attempt to recover deleted files.

  This artifact uploads all streams from an MFTId. If the MFT entry is
  not allocated there is a chance that the cluster that contain the
  actual data of the file will be intact still on the disk. Therefore
  this artifact can be used to attempt to recover a deleted file.

  A common use is to recover deleted directory entries using the
  Windows.NTFS.I30 artifact and identify MFT entries of interest. This
  is artifact can be used to attempt to recover some data.
