name: Windows.NTFS.MFT
description: |
  This artifact parses $MFT files and returns rows of each in scope  MFT record.
  This artifact can be used as the basis for other artifacts where the MFT needs
  to be queried or for deleted file recovery.

  For deleted file recovery: Take the MFT ID of a file of interest and provide
  it to the Windows.NTFS.Recover artifact.

  To query all attached ntfs drives: check the AllDrives switch.

  I have added several filters to uplift search capabilities from the original
  MFT artifact. Due to the multi-drive features, the MFTPath will output the MFT
  path of the entry.

  Available filters include:
  - FullPath regex
  - FileName regex
  - Time bounds to select files with a timestamp within time ranges
  - FileSize bounds
