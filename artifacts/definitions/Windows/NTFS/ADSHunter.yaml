   This artifact hunts
   for Alternate Data Streams on NTFS file systems. 
   Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes for covert storage in order to evade 
   detection. 
   Alternate Data Streams (ADS) are additional $DATA attributes for an MFT entry in 
   NTFS file systems. In NTFS, the primary $DATA attribute is 
   never named but subsequent $DATA attributes must be named.
   
   Targetting is via mix of path globs and include / exclude regex. 
   
   - TargetFolder is a folder glob: e.g C:\, C:\Users\*\Downloads that the user wishes 
   to recursively search.  
   - AdsName is name in glob format: e.g *, Zone.Identifier or Zone.*. 
   - AdsNameExclusion - A regex value, common ADS added to exclusions have been 
   added by default. The artifact also exlcudes NTFS system files by default.
