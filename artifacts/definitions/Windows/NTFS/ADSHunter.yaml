   This artifact hunts
   for Alternate Data Streams on NTFS file systems.
   Adversaries may use NTFS file attributes for covert storage to evade
   detection.
   Alternate Data Streams (ADS) are additional $DATA attributes for an MFT entry in
   NTFS file systems. In NTFS, the primary $DATA attribute is
   never named but subsequent $DATA attributes must be named.

   Targeting is via mix of path globs and include / exclude regex.

   - TargetGlob is a glob to target for ADS. NOTE **\* is recursive. To hit C drive we need to search for C:\*
   - AdsName is name in glob format: e.g *, Zone.Identifier or Zone.*.
   - AdsNameExclusion - A regex value, common ADS added to exclusions have been
   added by default. The artifact also excludes NTFS system files by default.
