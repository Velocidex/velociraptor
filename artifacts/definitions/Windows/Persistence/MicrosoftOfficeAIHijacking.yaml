description: |
    Office executables like WINWORD.exe look for AI.exe under the 
    %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Office\root\<Office Version> and 
    %ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft Office\root\<Office Version> directories. 
    An attacker may place a malicious AI.exe there in order to have persistence 
    whenever a user interacts with the Microsoft Office Suite.
