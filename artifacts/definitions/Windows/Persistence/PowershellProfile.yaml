  This Artifact will search and parse PowerShell profile scripts.

  PowerShell supports several profiles depending on the user or host program.
  Adversaries may create or modify these profiles to include arbitrary commands,
  functions, modules, and/or PowerShell drives to gain persistence. When a
  backdoored PowerShell session is opened the modified script will be executed
  unless the -NoProfile flag is used when it is launched.

  The artifact will by default search both User profiles and System-wide
  configured profiles. The user can also target and exclude specific content
  with relevant regex filters.
