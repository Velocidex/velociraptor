name: Windows.Persistence.SilentProcessExit
description: |
  Windows allows specific configuration of various executables via a
  registry key. The silent exit monitoring key allows a user to attach
  a program that executes when another program exits.

  Limitations: This queries the live registry and therefore does not 
  parse data in Windows.old or Regback folders, or VSS.
  An additional modification is required to 'Image File Execution Options'
  however this data isn't collected in this artifact.
