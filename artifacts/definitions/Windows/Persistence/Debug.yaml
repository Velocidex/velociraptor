description: |
  Windows allows specific configuration of various executables via a
  registry key. Some keys allow defining a debugger to attach to a
  program as it is run. If this debugger is launched for commonly used
  programs (e.g. notepad) then another program can be launched at the
  same time (with the same privileges).
