name: Windows.Persistence.Debug
description: |
  Windows allows specific configuration of various executables via a
  registry key. Some keys allow defining a debugger to attach to a
  program as it is run. If this debugger is launched for commonly used
  programs (e.g. notepad) then another program can be launched at the
  same time (with the same privileges).

  There is an additional key for x86 executables `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\
  SOFTWARE\wow6432node\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File
  Execution Options\*` however this is kept inline with the x64 key and
  therefore does not need to be processed.

  Limitations: This queries the live registry and therefore does not
  parse data in Windows.old or Regback folders, or VSS.
