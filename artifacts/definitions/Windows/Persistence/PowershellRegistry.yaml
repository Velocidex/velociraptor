name: Windows.Persistence.PowershellRegistry
description: |
  A common method of persistence is to install a hook into a user profile
  registry hive, using PowerShell. When the user logs in, the PowerShell script
  downloads a payload and executes it.

  This artifact searches the user's profile registry hive for signatures related
  to general PowerShell execution. We use a YARA signature specifically
  targeting the user's profile which we extract by using raw NTFS parsing (in
  case the user is currently logged on and the registry hive is locked).

parameters:
  - name: yaraRule
    type: yara
    default: |
      rule PowerShell {
        strings:
          $a = /ActiveXObject.{,500}eval/ wide nocase

        condition:
          any of them
      }
  - name: userRegex
    default: .

                 expand(path=Directory) AS HomeDir
          FROM Artifact.Windows.Sys.Users()
          WHERE HomeDir and Gid AND Name =~ userRegex
        },
        query={

                 String.Offset AS Off,
