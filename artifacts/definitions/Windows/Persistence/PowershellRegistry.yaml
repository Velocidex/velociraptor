name: Windows.Persistence.PowershellRegistry
description: |
  A common way of persistence is to install a hook into a user profile
  registry hive, using powershell. When the user logs in, the
  powershell script downloads a payload and executes it.

  This artifact searches the user's profile registry hive for
  signatures related to general Powershell execution. We use a yara
  signature specifically targeting the user's profile which we extract
  using raw NTFS parsing (in case the user is currently logged on and
  the registry hive is locked).
