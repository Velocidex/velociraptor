name: Windows.Events.EventLogModifications
description: |
  It is possible to disable windows event logs on a per channel or per
  provider basis. Attackers may disable critical log sources to
  prevent detections.

  This artifact monitors the state of the event log system from the
  registry and attempts to detect when event logs were disabled.
