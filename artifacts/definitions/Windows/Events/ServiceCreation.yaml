name: Windows.Events.ServiceCreation
description: |
  Monitor for creation of new services.

  New services are typically created by installing new software or
  kernel drivers. Attackers will sometimes install a new service to
  either insert a malicious kernel driver or as a persistence
  mechanism.

  This event monitor extracts the service creation events from the
  event log and records them on the server.
