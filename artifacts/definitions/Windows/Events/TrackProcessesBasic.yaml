name: Windows.Events.TrackProcessesBasic
description: |
  A basic process tracker which uses a simple polled pslist().

  The Process Tracker keeps track of exited processes, and resolves process call
  chains from it in memory cache.

  This event artifact enables the global process tracker and makes it possible
  to run many other artifacts that depend on the process tracker.

  This tracker DOES NOT require Sysmon and is **incompatible** with
  `Windows.Events.TrackProcesses` and
  `Windows.Events.TrackProcessesETW` (only one should be running).

type: CLIENT_EVENT

parameters:
  - name: MaxSize
    type: int64
    description: Maximum size of the in memory process cache (default 10k)
  - name: PollPeriod
    type: int64
    description: How often to run pslist to track processes (in Seconds)
    default: 60
