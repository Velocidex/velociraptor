name: Windows.Events.TrackProcesses
description: |
  This artifact uses sysmon and pslist to keep track of running
  processes using the Velociraptor process tracker.

  The Process Tracker keeps track of exited processes, and resolves
  process callchains from it in memory cache.

  This event artifact enables the global process tracker and makes it
  possible to run many other artifacts that depend on the process
  tracker.
