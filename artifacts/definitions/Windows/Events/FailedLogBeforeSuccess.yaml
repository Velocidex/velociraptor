name: Windows.Events.FailedLogBeforeSuccess
description: |
  Sometimes attackers will brute force an local user's account's
  password. If the account password is strong, brute force attacks are
  not effective and might not represent a high value event in
  themselves.

  However, if the brute force attempt succeeds, then it is a very high
  value event (since brute forcing a password is typically a
  suspicious activity).

  On the endpoint this looks like a bunch of failed logon attempts in
  quick succession followed by a successful login.

  NOTE: In order for this artifact to work we need Windows to be
  logging failed account login. This is not on by default and should
  be enabled via group policy.

  You can set the policy in Group Policy Management Console (GPMC):
  `Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Audit Policy`.
