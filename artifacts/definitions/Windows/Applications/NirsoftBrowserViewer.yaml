  This artifact wraps the Nirsoft BrowsingHistoryView tool - a tool
  for parsing browser history from a variety of browsers.

  More information about the tool can be found here
  https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/browsing_history_view.html

  NOTE: This binary is treated as malware by many detection engines
  since it is capable of dumping user passwords and search history!!!
  Running it on the endpoint may (hopefully) trigger endpoint defenses.
