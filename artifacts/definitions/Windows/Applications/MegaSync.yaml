parameters:

  - name: SearchRegex
    description: "Regex of strings to search in line."
    default: 'Transfer\s\(UPLOAD\)|upload\squeue|local\sfile\saddition\sdetected|Sync\s-\ssending\sfile|\"user\"'
    type: regex

    default:
    type: regex

  - name: VSSAnalysisAge
    type: int
    default: 0
    description: |
      If larger than zero we analyze VSS within this many days
      ago. (e.g 7 will analyze all VSS within the last week).  Note
      that when using VSS analysis we have to use the ntfs accessor
      for everything which will be much slower.
