name: Windows.Applications.OfficeMacros
description: |
  Scans through a given directory glob for common office files. Then tries to
  extract any embedded macros by parsing the OLE file structure.

  Office macros are a prominent initial infection vector. Many users click
  through the warning dialogs, thus leading to infection.

  If a macro calls an external program (e.g. PowerShell) this is very
  suspicious!

    default: "*.{xls,xlsm,doc,docx,ppt,pptm}"
