name: Windows.Applications.Chrome.Cookies
description: |
  Enumerate the users chrome cookies.

  The cookies are typically encrypted by the DPAPI using the user's
  credentials. Since Velociraptor is typically not running in the user
  context we can not decrypt these. It may be possible to decrypt the
  cookies off line.

  The pertinant information from a forensic point of view is the
  user's Created and LastAccess timestamp and the fact that the user
  has actually visited the site and obtained a cookie.

  - name: cookieGlobs
