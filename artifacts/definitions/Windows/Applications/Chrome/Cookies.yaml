name: Windows.Applications.Chrome.Cookies
description: |
  Enumerate the users chrome cookies.

  The cookies are typically encrypted by the DPAPI using the user's
  credentials. Since Velociraptor is typically not running in the user
  context we cannot decrypt these. It may be possible to decrypt the
  cookies off line.

  The pertinent information from a forensic point of view are the
  user's Created and LastAccess timestamps, and the fact that the user
  has actually visited the site and obtained a cookie.
