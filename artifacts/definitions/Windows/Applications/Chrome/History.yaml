description: |
  Enumerates a targets chrome history. Source based on Hindsight and code review of https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/history/core/browser/history_types.h. NOTE: Some research has shown that older browsers may not have this table, then you should be treating it as you would in a traditional investigation, this changes is aimed at taking advantage of the newer tables to reduce false postitives.
