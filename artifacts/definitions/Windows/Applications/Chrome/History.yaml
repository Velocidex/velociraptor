  Enumerates a targets chrome history.

  Source based on Hindsight and code review of
  https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/master:components/history/core/browser/history_types.h.

  #### NOTES:

  - Some research has shown that older browsers may not have this
    table. In that case you should treat it as you would in a traditional
    investigation. This artifact is aimed at taking advantage of the
    newer tables to reduce false positives.

  - This artifact is deprecated in favor of `Generic.Forensic.SQLiteHunter` and
    will be removed in future
