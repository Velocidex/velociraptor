  Fetch Chrome extensions.

  Chrome extensions are installed into the user's home directory.  We
  search for manifest.json files in a known path within each system
  user's home directory. We then parse the manifest file as JSON.

  Many extensions use locale packs to resolve strings like name and
  description. In this case we detect the default locale and load
  those locale files. We then resolve the extension's name and
  description from there.

  This artifact is deprecated in favor of
  Generic.Forensic.SQLiteHunter and will be removed in future
