    Execute Eric Zimmerman's SBECmd and return output for analysis.

    SBECmd is a CLI for analyzing Shellbags data.

    Objective:

    - Find which folders were accessed on the local machine, the
      network, and/or removable devices. Evidence of previously
      existing folders after deletion/overwrite. When certain folders
      were accessed.

    Interpretation:

    - Stores information about which folders were most recently
      browsed by the user.

    NOTE: Velociraptor can now parse Shellbags natively with the
    `Windows.Forensics.Shellbags` artifact.
