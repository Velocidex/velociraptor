  Carve URN Journal records from the disk.

  The USN journal is a very important source of information about when
  and how files were manipulated on the filesystem. However, typically
  the journal is rotated within a few days.

  This artifact carves out USN journal entries from the raw disk. This
  might recover older entries which have since been rotated from the
  journal file.

  ## Notes

  1. Like all carving, USN carving is not very reliable. You
     would tend to use it to corroborate an existing theory or to
     discover new leads.

  2. This artifact takes a long time to complete - you should
     probably increase the collection timeout past 10 minutes (usually
     more than an hour).

  3. The reassembled FullPath is derived from the MFTId referenced in
     the USN record. Bear in mind that this might be out of date and
     inaccurate.

  4. If you need to carve from a standalone file (e.g. collection from
     `Windows.KapeFiles.Targets`) you should use the
     Windows.Carving.USNFiles artifact instead.
