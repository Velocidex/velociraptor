  Run this artifact twice, the first time, set the StartTrace flag to
  True to start the PCAP collection, this will have the VQL return a
  single row (the TraceFile generated) When you want to stop
  collecting, and transform this TraceFile to a PCAP, re-run this
  artifact with StartTrace as false, and put path of the .etl file
  created in the previous step in the TraceFile. This will then
  convert the .etl to a PCAP and upload it.
