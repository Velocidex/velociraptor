name: Windows.Triage.SDS
description: |
  Collects the $Secure:$SDS stream from the NTFS volume. The $Secure
  stream is both a directory (it has I30 stream) and a file (it has a
  $DATA stream) and therefore confuses the Windows.KapeFiles.Target
  artifact which relies on globbing. Use this artifact to collect the
  $SDS stream.
