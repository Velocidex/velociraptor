name: Windows.EventLogs.PowershellScriptblock
description: |
  This Artifact will search and extract ScriptBlock events (Event ID 4104) from 
  Powershell-Operational Event Logs.
  
  Powershell is commonly used by attackers accross all stages of the attack 
  lifecycle. A valuable hunt is to search Scriptblock logs for signs of 
  malicious content.
  
  There are several parameter's availible for search leveraging regex.    
    - SearchStrings enables regex search over scriptblock text field.  
    - stringWhiteList enables a regex whitelist for scriptblock text field.  
    - pathWhitelist enables a regex whitelist for path of scriptblock.  
    - dateAfter enables search for events after this date.  
    - dateBefore enables search for events before this date.

      Powershell: Scriptblock
      =======================
      Powershell is commonly used by attackers accross all stages of the attack 
      lifecycle.  
      A valuable hunt is to search Scriptblock logs for signs of malicious 
      content. Stack ranking these events can provide valuable leads from which 
      to start an investigation.
