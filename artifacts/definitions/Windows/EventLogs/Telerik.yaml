  This Artifact will hunt for evidence of Telerik exploitation in the Application 
  Event Log.  
 
  Telerik is a commonly exploited component of IIS web pages that has been 
  actively targeted by actors via several CVEs. Several tools and attack 
  capabilities exist making exploitation of vulnerable services trivial. Due to 
  the nature of the software and typical deployments the patches may require 
  manual application.  
  
  IocRegex enables searching for regex in the whole EventData field.  
  Output of this artifact is targeted fields from EventID 1309 to provide 
  context for the hit.
  
  This Artifact will hunt for evidence of Telerik exploitation in the Application Event Log.
