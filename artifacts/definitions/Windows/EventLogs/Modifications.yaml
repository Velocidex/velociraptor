name: Windows.EventLogs.Modifications
description: |
  It is possible to disable windows event logs on a per channel or per
  provider basis. Attackers may disable ciritcal log sources to
  prevent detections.

  This artifact reads the state of the event log system from the
  registry and attempts to detect when event logs were disabled.

precondition:
  SELECT * FROM info() WHERE OS =~ "windows"

parameters:
  - name: ProviderRegex
    default: .
  - name: DateAfter
    description: "search for modifications after this date. YYYY-MM-DDTmm:hh:ss Z"
    type: timestamp
  - name: DateBefore
    description: "search for modifications before this date. YYYY-MM-DDTmm:hh:ss Z"
    type: timestamp
