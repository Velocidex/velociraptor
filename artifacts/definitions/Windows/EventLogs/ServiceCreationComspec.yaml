name: Windows.EventLogs.ServiceCreationComspec
description: |
  Detects the string "COMSPEC" (nocase) in Windows Service
  Creation (SCM) events. That is: EventID 7045 from the System event log.

  This detects many hack tools that use SCM based lateral movement
  including `smbexec`.

  If `VSSAnalysisAge` is non-zero then this enables querying VSS instances for
  the `EventLog` path, which includes event deduplication.

parameters:
  - name: EventLog
    default: C:\Windows\system32\winevt\logs\System.evtx
  - name: ComspecRegex
    default: "(COMSPEC|cmd.exe|ADMIN\\$)"
    type: regex

  - name: VSSAnalysisAge
    type: int
    default: 0

      If larger than zero we analyze VSS within this many days
      ago. (e.g 7 will analyze all VSS within the last week).  Note
      that when using VSS analysis we have to use the ntfs accessor
      for everything which will be much slower.
