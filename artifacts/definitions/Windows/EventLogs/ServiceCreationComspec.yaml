  This Detection hts on the string "COMSPEC" (nocase) in Windows Service
  Creation events. That is: EventID 7045 from the System event log. 

  This detects many hack tools that leverage SCM based lateral movement 
  including smbexec.
  
  SearchVSS allows querying VSS instances of EventLog Path with event 
  deduplication.
