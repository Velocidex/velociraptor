description: |
   This artifact allows deployment of the BloodHound collection tool Sharphound.

   BloodHound is a popular Active Directory Assessment tool that uses graph
   theory to reveal the hidden and often unintended relationships. It can also be
   used to identify and eliminate potentially risky domain configuration.

   The Sharphound collection is in json format and upload to the server for
   additional processing.

   NOTE: Do not run this artifact as an unrestricted hunt. General recommendation
   is to run this artifact on only a handful of machines in a typical domain,
   then deduplicate output.
