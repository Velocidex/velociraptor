name: Windows.Sys.Programs
description: |
  Represents products as they are installed by Windows Installer. A product generally
  correlates to one installation package on Windows. Some fields may be blank as Windows
  installation details are left to the discretion of the product author.

  Limitations: This key parses the live registry hives - if a user is not logged in then their data will not be resident in HKU and therefore you should parse the hives on disk (including within VSS/Regback).
