      # Users Hunt

      Enumerating all the users on all endpoints can reveal machines
      which had an unexpected login activity. For example, if a user
      from an unrelated department is logging into an endpoint by
      virtue of domain credentials, this could mean their account is
      compromised and the attackers are laterally moving through the
      network.

         WHERE NOT UUID =~ "(-5..$|S-1-5-18|S-1-5-19|S-1-5-20)"

      ============

      {{ .Description }}

      The following table shows basic information about the users on this system.

      * Remote users also show the modification timestamp from the
        registry key.

      * Local users show the mtime of their home directory.

      {{ define "users" }}
