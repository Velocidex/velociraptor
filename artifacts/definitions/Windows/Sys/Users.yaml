description: |
  List User accounts by inspecting registry keys. This method is a
  reliable indicator for users who have physically logged into the
  system and thereby created local profiles.

  This will not include domain users or the output from `NetUserEnum`
  - you should collect the `Windows.Sys.AllUsers` artifact to get all
  possible users on the system.

  - name: remoteRegKey
