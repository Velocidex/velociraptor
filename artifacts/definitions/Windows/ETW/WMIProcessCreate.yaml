name: Windows.ETW.WMIProcessCreate
description: |
  This artifact the endpoints for process creation through WMI
  events. This is a common attacker lateral movement technique.

  The technique works by calling the Create() method on the
  win32_process WMI object.

  You can test this with PowerShell:
  Invoke-WmiMethod -Path win32_process -Name create -ArgumentList notepad.exe

  This artifact uses the EWT provider:
  Microsoft-Windows-WMI-Activity           {1418EF04-B0B4-4623-BF7E-D74AB47BBDAA}

type: CLIENT_EVENT
