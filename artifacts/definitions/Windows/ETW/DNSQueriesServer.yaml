   Logs DNS queries on DNS servers.

   This is useful for identifying the true source system that is initiating
   malicious DNS requests that you may have observed.

   Note that this can be resource intensive for the CPU on busy DNS servers -
   from 5% to 70% CPU load of one core, but memory consumption is very low. This
   is still a lot less than enabling DNS debug logging.
