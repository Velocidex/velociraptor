  Windows Registry access is a great source of visibility into system
  activity.

  There are many ways of gaining visibility into this, the most
  reliable being Sysmon. However it is also possible to gain some
  visibility using ETW. The Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Registry provides
  ETW events for registry modifications.

  This artifact parses these events and ties them back to the
  accessing process. We recommend running this artifact with the
  process tracker.

  NOTE: Experience shows this ETW provider is not very reliable and seems to
  miss a lot of registry events. This artifact should therefore be considered
  experimental.
