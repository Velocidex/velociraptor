name: Windows.ETW.FileCreation
description: |
   This artifact watches the Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-File provider
   for new file creation events.

   We also include the process that created the file, and a process
   call chain.

   NOTE: This artifact uses the process tracker so it works a lot
   better when the process tracker is enabled.
