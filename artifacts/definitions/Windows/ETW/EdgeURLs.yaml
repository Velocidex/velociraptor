name: Windows.ETW.EdgeURLs
description: |
  Collects all URLs accessed by the Edge browser using ETW.

  It also serves as an example of an ETW artifact, in this case using the
  provider:

  `Microsoft-Windows-URLMon       {245F975D-909D-49ED-B8F9-9A75691D6B6B}`

  NOTE: This artifact can generate a lot of data - you probably want
  to filter the URLs a bit and/or target collection to a narrow label
  group.
