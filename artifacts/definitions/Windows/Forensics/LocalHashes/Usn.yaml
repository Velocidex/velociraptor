name: Windows.Forensics.LocalHashes.Usn
description: |
  This artifact maintains a local (client side) database of file
  hashes. It is then possible to query this database by using the
  `Generic.Forensic.LocalHashes.Query` artifact

type: CLIENT_EVENT

parameters:
  - name: PathRegex
    description: A regex to match the entire path (you can watch a directory or a file type).
    default: .
    type: regex

  - name: Device
    description: The NTFS drive to watch
    default: C:\\

  - name: HashDb
    description: Name of the local hash database
    default: hashdb.sqlite

  - name: SuppressOutput
    description: If this is set, the artifact does not return any rows to the server but will still update the local database.
    type: bool

  - name: UsnCheckPeriod
    type: int
    description: Dedup all file operations that occur within this period
    default: "10"

precondition: SELECT OS from info() where OS = "windows"
