description: |
  Windows keeps a cache of prefetch files. When an executable is run,
  the system records properties about the executable to make it faster
  to run next time. By parsing this information we are able to
  determine when binaries are run in the past. On Windows10 we can see
  the last 8 execution times and creation time (9 potential executions).  
    
  There are several parameter's availible for this artifact.  
    - dateAfter enables search for prefetch evidence after this date.  
    - dateBefore enables search for prefetch evidence before this date.   
    - binaryRegex enables to filter on binary name, e.g evil.exe.  
    - hashRegex enables to filter on prefetch hash.
