    "SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is a SolarWinds digitally-signed component of the Orion software framework that contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third party servers."

    We can look for evidence of this dll, by first performing a YARA search on the MFT across all drives, then applying an addition Fireye-supplied rule against the file found via MFT.
