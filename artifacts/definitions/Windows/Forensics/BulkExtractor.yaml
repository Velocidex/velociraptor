    This content will execute bulk_extractor with record carving plugins from
    4n6ist. Initially developed to carve EventLogs from physical disk and
    unallocated space, this content may also be used for other
    bulk extractor capability. Best use case is for remote targeted machine
    collection to remove the need for a disk image.

    **Settings**
    Target - Can be `\\\\.\\PhysicalDrive[X], \\\\?\\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy[Y]`
    or `C:\\Folder\\Path`
    TargetAllPhysical - boolean option to include all attached physical disks
    TargetVSS - boolean option to target all VSC
    CarveEvtx - boolean option to include evtx carving
    FindRegex - regex to include for BulkExtractor find plugins

    FreeCommand - supersedes evtx or find options and allows free form switch
    generation for ad-hoc use cases.
    e.g `-E evtx, -e zip -S unzip_carve_mode=2'`
    Will add:
    command prefix: `-q 99999999999 -R'` and
    postfix: `-o [Outfolder] [Target]`.
    To make: `bulk_extractor q 99999999999 -R -E evtx, -e zip -S unzip_carve_mode=2 -o [outfolder] [Target]`

    If FindRegex or `-f` has been used in FreeCommand the artifact will attempt
    to parse `find.txt` output.

    **Note**
    1. Currently only supported for x64 bit machines.
    2. This artifact usually takes a long time. Ensure default timeout is high
    enough for completion.
    3. This content is NOT recommended for hunting without great consideration as
    bulk_extractor is a multithreaded tool and utilizes all CPU available on the
    endpoint.
    4. The artifact copies carved data to the local disk prior to upload which
    is not ideal from a forensic viewpoint.
