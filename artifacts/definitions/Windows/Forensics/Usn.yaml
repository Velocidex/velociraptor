  NTFS is a journal filesystem. This means that it maintains a journal
  file where intended filesystem changes are written first, then the
  filesystem is changed. This journal is called the USN journal in NTFS.

  Velociraptor can parse the USN journal from the filesystem. This
  provides an indication of recent file changes. Typically the system
  maintains the journal of around 30mb and depending on system
  activity this can go back quite some time.

  Use this artifact to determine the times when a file was
  modified/added from the journal. This will be present even if the
  file was later removed.
