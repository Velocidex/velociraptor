name: Windows.Search.SMBFileFinder
description: |
  Find files on a remote filesystem using the filename or content.

  ## Security Note

  To access a remote share we require the credentials of a
  domain user. Currently only username/password are supported (i.e. no
  Kerberose). You should use Group Policy to create a user with read
  only access to the remote share.

  ## Performance Note

  This artifact can be quite expensive slow and generate a lot of
  network data, especially if we search file content. It will require
  opening each file and reading its entire content. To minimize the
  impact on the endpoint we recommend this artifact is collected with
  a rate limited way (about 20-50 ops per second).
