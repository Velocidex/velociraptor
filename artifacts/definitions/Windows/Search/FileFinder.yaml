name: Windows.Search.FileFinder
description: |
  Find files on the filesystem using the filename or content.


  ## Performance Note

  This artifact can be quite expensive, especially if we search file
  content. It will require opening each file and reading its entire
  content. To minimize the impact on the endpoint we recommend this
  artifact is collected with a rate limited way (about 20-50 ops per
  second).

  This artifact is useful in the following scenarios:

    * We need to locate all the places on our network where customer
      data has been copied.

    * Weâ€™ve identified malware in a data breach, named using short
      random strings in specific folders and need to search for other
      instances across the network.

    * We believe our user account credentials have been dumped and
      need to locate them.

    * We need to search for exposed credit card data to satisfy PCI
      requirements.

    * We have a sample of data that has been disclosed and need to
      locate other similar files
