description: |
  This artifact will find all relevant files in the VSS. Typically used to
  out deduplicated paths for processing by other artifacts.

  Input either search Glob or FullPath.
  Output is standard Glob results with additional fields:
  SHA1 hash for deduplication,
  Type for prioritisation, and
  Deduped to indicate if FullPath has been deduped with another row.
