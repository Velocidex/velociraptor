name: Windows.Detection.PsexecService.Kill
description: |
    Psexec can launch a service remotely. This artifact implements a
    client side response plan whereby all the child processes of the
    service are killed.

    NOTE: There is an inherent race between detection and response. If
    the PsExec is very quick we will miss it.
