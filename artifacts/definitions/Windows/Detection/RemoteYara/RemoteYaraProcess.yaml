  Scanning process memory for signals is powerfull technique. This
  artifact scans processes with a remote yara rule.
  
  The User can define a rule URL or use the default Velociraptor "Public" 
  share: https://\<server\>/public/remote.yar
  
  Output of the rule hits are process information, Yara rule name, metadata 
  and hit data. This content also provides the user the option to dump any 
  process with hits, and the rule summary information.
