  Scanning process memory for signals is powerful technique. This
  artefact scans processes with a remote yara rule.

  The User can define a rule URL or use the default Velociraptor "Public" share:
  https://\<server\>/public/remote.yar

  This content also provides the user the option to dump any process with hits,
  and the rule summary information.

  The user is also recommended to add any endpoint agents that may cause a false 
  positive into the hidden parameters pathWhitelist.

  Output of the rule is process information, Yara rule name, metadata and hit
  data.
