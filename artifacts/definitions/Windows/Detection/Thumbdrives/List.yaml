description: |
  Users inserting Thumb drives or other Removable drive pose a
  constant security risk. The external drive may contain malware or
  other undesirable content. Additionally thumb drives are an easy way
  for users to exfiltrate documents.

  This artifact watches for any removable drives and provides a
  complete file listing to the server for any new drive inserted. It
  also provides information about any addition to the thumb drive
  (e.g. a new file copied onto the drive).

  We exclude very large removable drives since they might have too
  many files.
