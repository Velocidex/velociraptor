description: |
  Users inserting Thumb drives or other Removable drive pose a
  constant security risk. The external drive may contain malware or
  other undesirable content. Additionally thumb drives are an easy way
  for users to exfiltrate documents.

  This artifact automatically scans any office files copied to a
  removable drive for keywords. This could be useful to detect
  exfiltration attempts of restricted documents.

  We exclude very large removable drives since they might have too
  many files.
