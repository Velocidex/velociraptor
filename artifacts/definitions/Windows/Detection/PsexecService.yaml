name: Windows.Detection.PsexecService
description: |
  PsExec works by installing a new service in the system. The service
  can be renamed by using the `-r` flag and therefore it is not enough to
  just watch for a new service called `psexecsvc.exe`. This artifact
  improves on this by scanning the service binary to detect the
  original PsExec binary.

  NOTE: If the service is very quick we are unable to examine the service binary
  in time then we will miss it.
