name: Windows.Detection.PsexecService
description: |
  PSExec works by installing a new service in the system. The service
  can be renamed using the -r flag and therefore it is not enough to
  just watch for a new service called psexecsvc.exe. This artifact
  improves on this by scanning the service binary to detect the
  original psexec binary.

  NOTE that if the service is very quick we are unable to examine
  the service binary in time and will miss it.
