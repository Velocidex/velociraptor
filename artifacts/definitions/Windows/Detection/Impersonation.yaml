  An access token is an object that describes the security context of
  a process or thread. The information in a token includes the
  identity and privileges of the user account associated with the
  process or thread. When a user logs on, the system verifies the
  user's password by comparing it with information stored in a
  security database.

  Every process has a primary token that describes the security
  context of the user account associated with the process. By default,
  the system uses the primary token when a thread of the process
  interacts with a securable object. Moreover, a thread can
  impersonate a client account. Impersonation allows the thread to
  interact with securable objects using the client's security
  context. A thread that is impersonating a client has both a primary
  token and an impersonation token.

  This artifact enumerates all threads on the system which have an
  impersonation token. That is, they are operating with a different token
  then the token the entire process has. For example Mimikatz has a
  command called `token::elevate` to do just such a thing:

  ```
  mimikatz # privilege::debug
  Privilege '20' OK

  mimikatz # token::elevate
  Token Id  : 0
  User name :
  SID name  : NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM

  688     {0;000003e7} 1 D 42171          NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM     S-1-5-18        (04g,21p)       Primary
  -> Impersonated !
  * Process Token : {0;000195ad} 1 F 757658339   DESKTOP-NHNHT65\mic     S-1-5-21-2310288903-2791442386-3035081252-1001  (15g,24p)       Primary
