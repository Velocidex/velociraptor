name: Windows.Detection.ForwardedImports
description: |
  In Windows a common DLL hooking technique is to replace a dll with a
  forwarder dll - i.e. one that forwards all imports to the real
  dll. If the forwarder DLL is placed earlier in the import order, the
  malicous DLL will be seamlessly loaded and injected into another
  process.

  This artifact searches for dlls which are named the same as the DLL
  they are forwarding to.
