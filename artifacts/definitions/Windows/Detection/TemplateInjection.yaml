    Detects injected templates in Office and RTF documents.

    Template injection is a form of defense evasion.
    For office documents a malicious macro is loaded into an OOXML document
    via a resource file masquerading as an office template. The OOXML artifact structure
    will also detect MSHTML RCE Vulnerability #CVE-2021-40444 which has a similar payload technique.
    For RTF documents, a malicious payload can be delivered by modifying document
    formatting control via the `\\\*\template` structure.


    This artifact can be modified to search for other suspicious `rels` files:

    - document.xml.rels = macros, ole objects, images.
    - settings.xml.rels = templates.
    - websettings.xml.rels = frames.
    - header#.xml.rels and footer#.xml.rels and others has also been observed
    hosting image files for canary files or abused for NetNTLM hash collection.

    Change TemplateFileRegex to `\\.xml\\.rels$` for looser file selection.
    Change TemplateTargetRegex to `^(https?|smb|\\\\|//|mhtml|file)` for looser
    Target selection.

    This artifact can also be modified to quickly deploy YARA based detections
    on other documents. Simply replace RtfYara with YARA rules of interest and
    modify the glob for targeting.
