  NTFS is a journal filesystem. This means that it maintains a journal
  file where intended filesystem changes are written first, then the
  filesystem is changed. This journal is called the USN journal in NTFS.

  Velociraptor can watch the USN journal for new filesystem
  events. This allows Velociraptor to detect when new files are
  created or modified.

  A common use case is to determine when a new prefetch file is
  modified (this indicates a binary was executed). Note: It seems
  prefetch files are not updated immediately - there could be a small
  delay between the execution and the prefetch being modified.
