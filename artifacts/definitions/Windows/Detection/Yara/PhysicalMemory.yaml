name: Windows.Detection.Yara.PhysicalMemory
description: |
  This artifact enables running YARA over physical memory.

  There are 2 kinds of YARA rules that can be deployed:

  1. URL link to a YARA rule.
  2. A standard YARA rule attached as a parameter.

  Only one method of YARA will be applied and search order is as above. The
  default is Cobalt Strike opcodes.

  The artifact will load the WinPmem driver, then YARA scan the
  physical memory and remove the driver.

  NOTE: This artifact is experimental and can crash the system!

  #### Handling signatures with fixed strings.

  When the signature specifies fixed strings, the YARA engine will
  load it into memory, causing the signature to match memory used by
  Velociraptor. To avoid this false positive encode the fixed
  string as an alternative string.

  For example instead of:
  ```
  $sequence_5 = { 250000ff00 33d0 8b4db0 c1e908 }
  ```

  Write as:
  ```
  $sequence_5 = { 250000ff00 33d0 8b4db0 c1e9 ( 08 | 08 ) }
  ```
