name: Windows.Detection.Yara.NTFS
author: Matt Green - @mgreen27
description: |
  This artifact searches the MFT, returns a list of target files then runs Yara
  over the target list.

  There are 3 kinds of Yara rules that can be deployed:

  1. Url link to a yara rule.
  2. Shorthand yara in the format `wide nocase ascii:string1,string2,string3`.
  3. or a Standard Yara rule attached as a parameter.

  Only one method of Yara will be applied and search order is as above.

  The artifact leverages Windows.NTFS.MFT so similar regex filters can be applied
  including Path, Size and date. The artifact also has an option to search across
  all attached drives and upload any files with Yara hits.

  Some examples of path regex may include:

  * Extension at a path: `Windows/System32/.+\\.dll$`
  * More wildcards: `Windows/.+/.+\\.dll$`
  * Specific file: `Windows/System32/kernel32\.dll$`
  * Multiple extentions: `\.(php|aspx|resx|asmx)$`

  Note: no drive and forward slashes - these expressions are for paths
  relative to the root of the filesystem.
