  This artifact enables running YARA over a Physical device and offset
  specific targeting.

  There are 2 kinds of YARA rules that can be deployed:

  1. Url link to a YARA rule.
  2. or a Standard YARA rule attached as a parameter.

  Only one method of YARA will be applied and search order is as above. The
  default is targeting the Master Boot Record (MBR).

  Note: by default the YARA scan will stop after one hit. Multi-string rules will also only
  show one string in returned rows.

  Due to scanning raw devices and size being potentially very large I have included
  an example on how to upload the MBR as the default YARA rule.

parameters:
  - name: DevicePath
    default: \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0
