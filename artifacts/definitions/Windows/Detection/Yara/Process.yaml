  This artifact enables running YARA over processes in memory.

  There are 2 kinds of YARA rules that can be deployed:

  1. URL link to a YARA rule.
  3. or a Standard YARA rule attached as a parameter.

  Only one method of YARA will be applied and search order is as above. The
  default is Cobalt Strike opcodes.

  Regex parameters can be applied for process name and pid for targeting. The
  artifact also has an option to upload any process with YARA hits.

  Note: by default the YARA scan will stop after one hit. Multi-string rules will also only
  show one string in returned rows.
  If upload is selected NumberOfHits is redundant and not advised as hits are
  grouped by path to ensure files only downloaded once.
