   Runs an Intezer agent scan on the endpoint.

   - Scan: The scanner collects running code from memory and sends it to Intezer Analyze.
     Scans take approximately five to ten minutes. The first scan may take additional time.

   Please note: The scanner only collects executable code, not documents or any other
   data that is not binary code.

   - Analyze: The collected modules are analyzed using Genetic Malware Analysis technology.
