name: Windows.Memory.PEDump
description: |
  This artifact dumps a PE file from memory and uploads the file to
  the server.

  NOTE: The output is not exactly the same as the original binary:
  1. Relocations are not fixed
  2. Due to ASLR the base address of the binary will not be the same as the original.

  The result is usually much better than the binaries dumped from a
  physical memory image (using e.g. Volatility) because reading
  process memory will page in any memory-mapped pages as we copy them
  out. Therefore we do not expect to have holes in the produced binary
  as is often the case in memory analysis.

parameters:
  - name: Pid
    type: int

      The base offset to dump from memory. If not provided, we dump
      all pe files from the PID.
