name: Windows.Memory.Acquisition
description: |
  Acquires a full memory image by using the built-in WinPmem driver.

  NOTE: This artifact usually transfers a lot of data. You should
  increase the default timeout to allow it to complete.

  Memory images are typically susceptible to a lot of smear. To
  minimize this we need to acquire memory as quickly as possible. This
  artifact offers a few compression methods for the output
  file. Reducing the size of the file will decrease time needed for IO
  but will increase CPU requirements so this is a
  trade-off. Empirically we found that using S2 compression gives a
  reasonable compression and very high speed reducing acquisition time
  from the no compression options significantly.

  To decompress the image you can use the [Go WinPmem binary](https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem/releases)

  ```
  go-winpmem.exe extract image.compressed image.raw
  ```
