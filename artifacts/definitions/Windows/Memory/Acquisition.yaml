  Acquires a full memory image. We download winpmem and use it to
  acquire a full memory image.

  NOTE: This artifact usually takes a long time. You should increase
  the default timeout to allow it to complete.

  By default we download the winpmem binary from the Github release
  page. If you want to host it on the Velociraptor server simply place
  the binary in the frontend's public directory and use the following URL.

  https://frontend:8000/public/winpmem.exe

parameters:
  - name: winPmemURL
    default: https://github.com/Velocidex/c-aff4/releases/download/v3.3.rc2/winpmem_v3.3.rc2.exe

  - queries:
      - |
        LET download = SELECT Content, Response, Complete, tempfile(data="X", extension=".aff4") AS Tempfile
            FROM http_client(url=winPmemURL, tempfile_extension=".exe")
      - |
        SELECT * FROM foreach(
          row=download,
          query={
            SELECT Stdout, Stderr,
                   if(condition=Complete,
                      then=upload(file=Tempfile)) As Upload
                   FROM execve(argv=[Content, "-dd", "-o", Tempfile, "-t", "-c", "snappy"],
                               sep="\r\n")
        })
