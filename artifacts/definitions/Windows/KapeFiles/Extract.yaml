name: Windows.KapeFiles.Extract
description: |
  The Windows.KapeFiles.Targets artifact collects files into a Zip
  file. Zip files can not generally preserve timestamps since they
  only have a single timestamp concept. Velociraptor will only record
  the modified time in the zip file header itself but all the times
  are present in the metadata file:

  "Windows.KapeFiles.Targets/All File Metadata.json"

  Sometimes, users wish to extract the contents of a collection to a
  directory, and run an external tool over the data. Some such
  external tools assume the file timestamps (e.g. prefetch files) are
  meaningful. In this case we need to preserve the timestamps.

  You can use this artifact to extract the content of a collection
  while preserving the timestamps. The artifact will read the metadata
  file, unpack the contents of the container and set the timestamps on
  the resulting file.

  NOTE: Windows allows 3 timestamps to be set (MAC time except for
  Btime), while Linux only allows 2 timestamps (Modified and
  Accessed).

  ## Example - command line invocation

  ```
  velociraptor-v0.6.1-rc1-linux-amd64 artifacts collect Windows.KapeFiles.Extract --args ContainerPath=Collection-DESKTOP-2OR51GL-2021-07-16_06_56_50_-0700_PDT.zip --args OutputDirectory=/tmp/MyOutput/
  ```

parameters:
  - name: MetadataFile
    default: "Windows.KapeFiles.Targets/All File Metadata.json"
    description: Name of the KapeFile.Targets metadata file.
  - name: OutputDirectory
    description: Directory to write on (must be set).
  - name: ContainerPath
    description: Path to container (zip file) to unpack.
