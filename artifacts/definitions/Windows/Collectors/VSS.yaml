   Collects files with VSS deduplication.

   Volume shadow copies is a windows feature where file system
   snapshots can be made at various times. When collecting files it is
   useful to go back through the VSS to see older versions of critical
   files.

   At the same time we dont want to collect multiple copies of the
   same data.

   This artifact runs the provided globs over all the VSS and collects
   the unique modified time + path combinations.

   If a file was modified in a previous VSS copy, this artifact will
   retrieve it at multiple shadow copies.

       A CSV file with a Glob column with all the globs to collect.
       NOTE: Globs must not have a leading device since the device
       will depend on the VSS.
