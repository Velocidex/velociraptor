   Collects files using a set of globs. All globs must be on the same
   device. The globs will be searched in one pass - so you can provide
   many globs at the same time.

       A CSV file with a Glob column with all the globs to collect.
       NOTE: Globs must not have a leading device since the device
       will depend on the VSS.
