  Sysmon is a kernel level system monitor written by
  Sysinternals. While we are not able to distribute Sysmon ourselves,
  Velociraptor can help you manage its deployment and installation.

  In order to deploy sysmon on the endpoint, you need to:

  1. Ensure the server contains the latest Sysmon binaries. You will
     need to download them yourself by running the
     `Windows.Utils.DownloadBinaries` server artifact.

  2. Ensure the sysmon configration is appropriate for your
     deployment. If you edit the file in your public directory
     (`<file store>/public/sysmon_config.xml`) you will need to run the
     `Windows.Utils.UpdatePublicHashes` server artifact to update the
     inventory file.
