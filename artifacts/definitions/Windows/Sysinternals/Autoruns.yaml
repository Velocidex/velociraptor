name: Windows.Sysinternals.Autoruns
description: |
  Uses Sysinternals autoruns to scan the host.

  Note this requires syncing the sysinternals binary from the host -
  you will need to run Windows.Utils.DownloadBinaries on the server
  first.

precondition: SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

parameters:
  - name: binaryURL
    description: |
      Specify this as the base of the binary store (if empty we use
      the server's public directory).
  - name: AutorunArgs
    description: |
      A space separated list of args to run with.
    default: |
      -nobanner -accepteula -t -a * -c *

sources:
  - queries:
      # Get the path to the binary.
      - |
        LET bin <= SELECT * FROM Artifact.Generic.Utils.FetchBinary(
              binaryURL=binaryURL, ToolName="Autorun")

      # Call the binary and return all its output in a single row.
      - |
        LET output = SELECT * FROM execve(argv=(bin[0]).FullPath +
           split(string=AutorunArgs, sep=" "),
           length=10000000)

      # Parse the CSV output and return it as rows. We can filter this further.
      - |
        SELECT * FROM foreach(
          row=output,
          query={
             SELECT * FROM parse_csv(filename=utf16(string=Stdout),
                                     accessor="data")
          })
