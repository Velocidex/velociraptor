name: Windows.Utils.FetchBinary
description: A utility artifact which fetches a binary from a URL and caches it on disk.
   We verify the hash of the binary on disk and if it does not match we fetch it again
   from the source URL.

   This artifact is designed to be called from other artifacts. The binary path will be
   emitted in the FullPath column.

parameters:
  - name: binaryURL
    default: https://live.sysinternals.com/tools/autorunsc64.exe
