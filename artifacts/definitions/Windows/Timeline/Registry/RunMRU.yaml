    # Output all available RunMRU registry keys in timeline format.

    RunMRU is when a user enters a command into the START > Run prompt.
    Entries will be logged in the user hive under:    Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU

    The artifact numbers all entries with the most recent at
    reg_mtime starting at 0. Second recent 1, Third recent 2 etc.

    Default output enables a line per MRU entry. The boolean parameter
    `groupResults` enables Grouped results with ordering.

    Note: This artifact will collect RunMRU from `ntuser.dat` files and
    may exclude very recent entries in transaction (HKCU).  Future
    versions of this content might address this gap.
