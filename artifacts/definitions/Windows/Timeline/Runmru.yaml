    # Output all available RunMRU registry keys in timeline format.
    
    RunMRU is when a user enters a command into the START > Run prompt.  
    Entries will be logged in the user hive under:    Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\RunMRU
    
    The artifact numbers all entries with the most recent at 
    reg_mtime starting at 0. Second recent 1, Third recent 2 etc. 
      
    There are two modes of output:  
    1. grouped - the default, which will include all RunMRU in one line.  
    2. splitResults  - which will output each registry key as a record with order in message. 
    
    Note: This artifact will collect RunMRU from ntuser.dat files and 
    may exclude very recent entries in transaction (HKCU).  Future 
    versions of this content will address this gap.
