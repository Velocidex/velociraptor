name: Windows.Detection.ProcessMemory
description: |
  Scanning process memory for signals is powerful technique. This
  artifact scans processes for a yara signature and when detected, the
  process memory is dumped and uploaded to the server.

precondition: SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

parameters:
  - name: processRegex
    default: notepad
  - name: yaraRule
    default: |
      rule Process {
         strings:
           $a = "this is a secret" nocase wide
           $b = "this is a secret" nocase
         condition:
           any of them
      }

sources:
  - queries:
      - LET processes = SELECT Name as ProcessName, CommandLine, Pid
            FROM pslist()
            WHERE Name =~ processRegex

      - LET hits = SELECT * FROM foreach(
          row=processes,
          query={
             SELECT ProcessName, CommandLine, Pid, Strings.Offset as Offsets
             FROM proc_yara(rules=yaraRule, pid=Pid)
          })

      - SELECT * FROM foreach(
          row=hits,
          query={
            SELECT ProcessName, CommandLine, Pid, Offsets, FullPath,
                   upload(file=FullPath) as CrashDump
