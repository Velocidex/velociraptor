name: Generic.Utils.FetchBinary
description: |
   A utility artifact which fetches a binary from a URL and caches it on disk.
   We verify the hash of the binary on disk and if it does not match we fetch it again
   from the source URL.

   This artifact is designed to be called from other artifacts. The
   binary path will be emitted in the FullPath column.

   In order to use this you must have run the
   `Server.Utils.DownloadBinaries` artifact in order to populate the
   server's public directory with the binaries.

parameters:
  - name: binaryURL
    description: |
      Specify this as the base of the binary store (if empty we use
      the server's public directory).
  - name: ToolName
    default: Autorun

  - name: SleepDuration
    default: "20"
    description: A time to sleep before fetching the binary.
