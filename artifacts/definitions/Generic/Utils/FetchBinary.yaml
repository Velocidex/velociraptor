name: Generic.Utils.FetchBinary
description: |
   A utility artifact which fetches a binary from a URL and caches it on disk.
   We verify the hash of the binary on disk and if it does not match we fetch it again
   from the source URL.

   This artifact is designed to be called from other artifacts. The
   binary path will be emitted in the FullPath column.

   As a result of launching an artifact with declared "tools"
   field, the server will populate the following environment
   variables.

   Tool_<ToolName>_HASH     - The hash of the binary
   Tool_<ToolName>_FILENAME - The filename to store it.
   Tool_<ToolName>_URL      - The URL.

parameters:
  - name: ToolName
    default: Autorun_amd64

  - name: SleepDuration
    default: "20"
    description: A time to sleep before fetching the binary.

  - name: ToolInfo
    type: hidden
    description: A dict containing the tool information.
