      # Client Footprint for {{ Get $client_info "0.os_info.fqdn" }}

      The client has a client ID of {{ Get $client_info "0.client_id" }}.
      Clients report the Velociraptor process footprint to the
      server every 10 seconds. The data includes the total CPU
      utilization, and the resident memory size used by the client.

      The following graph shows the total utilization. Memory
      utilization is meausred in `Mb` while CPU Utilization is
      measured by `Percent of one core`.

      We would expect the client to use around 1-5% of one core when
      idle, but if a heavy hunt is running this might climb
      substantially.

      ## VQL Query

      The following VQL query was used to plot the graph above.

      ```sql
      {{ template "resources" }}
      ```
