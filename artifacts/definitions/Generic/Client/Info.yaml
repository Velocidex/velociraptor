  Collect basic information about the client.

  This artifact is collected when any new client is enrolled into the
  system. Velociraptor will watch for this artifact and populate its
  internal indexes from this artifact as well.

  You can edit this artifact to enhance the client's interrogation
  information as required, by adding new sources.

  NOTE: Do not modify the BasicInformation source since it is used to
  interrogate the clients.
