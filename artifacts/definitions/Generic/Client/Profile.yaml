name: Generic.Client.Profile
description: |
  This artifact collects profiling information about the running
  client. This is useful when you notice a high CPU load in the client
  and want to know why.

  The following options are most useful:

  1. Goroutines: This shows the backtraces of all currently running
     goroutines. It will generally show most of the code working in the
     current running set of queries.

  2. Heap: This shows all allocations currently in use and where they
     are allocated from. This is useful if the client is taking too
     much memory.

  3. Profile: This takes a CPU profile of the running process for the
     number of seconds specified in the Duration parameter. You can
     read profiles using:

  ```
  go tool pprof -callgrind -output=profile.grind profile.bin
  kcachegrind profile.grind
  ```

  Note that this really only makes sense when another query is running
  at the same time since this artifacts itself will not be doing very
  much other than just measuring the state of the process.
