name: Generic.Client.Rekey
description: |
  This artifact forces the client to regenerate its client id.

  This is normally not needed! You will only need to use this artifact in very
  specific situations, such as when the Velociraptor client was accidentally
  incorporated into a VM image with an existing writeback file. This will cause
  multiple cloned systems to connect with the same client id, and the server
  will then reject those clients with a HTTP "409 Rejected" message.

  If this happens, you can use the `Server.Monitor.ClientConflict` artifact to
  schedule collection of this artifact against rejected clients automatically.

  The `Wait` parameter controls how long we wait before restarting the client.
  Reduce this number if you need to rekey a lot of clients quickly.
