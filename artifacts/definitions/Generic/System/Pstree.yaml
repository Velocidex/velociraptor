  This artifact displays the call chain for every process on the
  system by traversing the process's parent ID.

  It is useful for establishing where a process came from - for
  example, if a powershell process is spawned from Winword (event via
  a number of intemediary processes) it could mean word was
  compromised.

  - name: ProcessNameRegex
