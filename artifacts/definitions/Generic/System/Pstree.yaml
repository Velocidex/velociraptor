  This artifact displays the call chain for every process on the
  system by traversing the process's parent ID.

  It is useful for establishing where a process came from - for
  example, if a powershell process is spawned from Winword (event via
  a number of intemediary processes) it could mean word was
  compromised.

  This artifact uses the process tracker which was introduced in
  release 0.6.5. (Import an older version of this artifact using the
  Server.Import.PreviousReleases if your client is older than this).

  A more accurate call chain will be available when the
  Windows.Events.TrackProcesses artifact is collected (required
  Sysmon) or Windows.Events.TrackProcessesBasic (does not require
  Sysmon)

  Minimum Version: 0.6.6
