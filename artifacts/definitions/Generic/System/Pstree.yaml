name: Generic.System.Pstree

  This artifact displays the call chain for every process on the
  system by traversing the process's parent ID.

  It is useful for establishing where a process came from - for
  example, if a PowerShell process is spawned from Winword (event via
  several intermediary processes) it could mean word was
  compromised.

  A more accurate call chain will be available when the
  Windows.Events.TrackProcesses artifact is collected (required
  Sysmon) or Windows.Events.TrackProcessesBasic (does not require
  Sysmon)
