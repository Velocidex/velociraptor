name: Generic.Applications.Office.Keywords
description: |
  Microsoft Office documents among other document format (such as
  LibraOffice) are actually stored in zip files. The zip file contain
  the document encoded as XML in a number of zip members.

  This makes it difficult to search for keywords within office
  documents because the ZIP files are typically compressed.

  This artifact searches for office documents by file extension and
  glob then uses the zip filesystem accessor to launch a yara scan
  again the uncompressed data of the document. Keywords are more
  likely to match when scanning the decompressed XML data.

  The artifact returns a context around the keyword hit.

  NOTE: The InternalMtime column shows the creation time of the zip
  member within the document which may represent when the document was
  initially created.
