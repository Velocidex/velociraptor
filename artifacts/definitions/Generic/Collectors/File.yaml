name: Generic.Collectors.File
description: |
   Collects files using a set of globs. All globs must be on the same
   device. The globs will be searched in one pass - so you can provide
   many globs at the same time.

aliases:
  - Windows.Collectors.File

parameters:
  - name: collectionSpec
    description: |
       A CSV file with a Glob column with all the globs to collect.
       NOTE: Globs must not have a leading device.
    type: csv
    default: |
       Glob
       Users\*\NTUser.dat
  - name: Root
    description: |
      On Windows, this is the device to apply all the glob on
      (e.g. `C:`). On *NIX, this should be a path to a subdirectory or
      /.
    default: "C:"
  - name: Accessor
    default: auto
    description: |
      On Windows, this can be changed to `ntfs`.
