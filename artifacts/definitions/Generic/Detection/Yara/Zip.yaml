    This artifact enables running YARA on embedded compressed files.

    The artifact:

    * firstly searches for compressed zip files (PK header)
    * then applies YARA on files inside.
    * files matching ZipFilenameRegex are recursively searched as above.

    The artifact is optimized to recursively search through embedded zip,
    jar,war and ear files by extracting any discovered containers.
    Select UploadHits to upload Discovered file for further analysis.  It is
    recommended to increase default artifact timeout for large servers or target
    glob.

    Some examples of path glob may include:

    * Specific container: `/path/here/file.zip`
    * Wildcards: `/var/www/*.{jar,war,ear}`
    * More wildcards: `/var/www/**/*.jar`
    * Windows: `C:/**/*.zip`

    NOTE: this artifact runs the glob plugin with the nosymlink switch
    turned on.  This will NOT follow any symlinks and may cause
    unexpected results if unknowingly targeting a folder with
    symlinks. YARA is not applied to the containers, only contained contents
    that are not containers.
