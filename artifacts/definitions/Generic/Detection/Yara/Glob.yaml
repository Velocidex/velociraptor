name: Generic.Detection.Yara.Glob
author: Matt Green - @mgreen27
description: |
  This artifact returns a list of target files then runs Yara over the target
  list.

  There are 2 kinds of Yara rules that can be deployed:

  1. Url link to a yara rule.
  2. or a Standard Yara rule attached as a parameter.

  Only one method of Yara will be applied and search order is as above.

  The artifact leverages Glob for search so relevant filters can be applied
  including Glob, Size and date. Date filters will target files with a timestamp
  before LatestTime and after EarliestTime. The artifact also has an option to
  upload any files with Yara hits.

  Some examples of path glob may include:

  * Specific binary: `/usr/bin/ls`
  * Wildcards: `/var/www/*.js`
  * More wildcards: `/var/www/**/*.js`
  * Multiple extentions: `/var/www/*\.{php,aspx,js,html}`
  * Windows: `C:/Users/**/*.{exe,dll,ps1,bat}`
  * Windows: `C:\Users\**\*.{exe,dll,ps1,bat}`

  NOTE: this artifact runs the glob plugin with the nosymlink switch turned on.
  This will NOT follow any symlinks and may cause unexpected results if
  unknowingly targeting a folder with symlinks.
  If upload is selected NumberOfHits is redundant and not advised as hits are
  grouped by path to ensure files only downloaded once.
