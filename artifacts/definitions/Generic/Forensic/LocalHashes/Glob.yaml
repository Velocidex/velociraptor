name: Generic.Forensic.LocalHashes.Glob
description: |
  This artifact maintains a local (client side) database of file
  hashes. It is then possible to query this database by using the
  `Generic.Forensic.LocalHashes.Query` artifact

  Maintaining hashes client side allows Velociraptor to answer the
  query - which machine has this hash on our network extremely
  quickly. Velociraptor only needs to lookup the each client's local
  database of file hashes.

  Maintaining this database case be done by using this artifact or by using
  the `Windows.Forensics.LocalHashes.Usn` artifact.

  This artifact simply crawls the filesystem hashing files as
  specified by the glob expression, and adds them to the local hash
  database. You can rate limit this artifact by using the ops/sec setting
  to perform a slow update of the local file hash database.

parameters:
  - name: HashGlob
    description: Search for files according to this glob and hash them.
    default: C:/Users/**/*.exe

  - name: HashDb
    description: Name of the local hash database
    default: hashdb.sqlite

  - name: SuppressOutput
    description: If this is set, the artifact does not return any rows to the server but will still update the local database.
