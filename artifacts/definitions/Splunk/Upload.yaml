name: Splunk.Flows.Upload

description: |
  This server side event monitoring artifact waits for new artifacts
  to be collected from endpoints and automatically uploads those to a
  Splunk server.
  To configure the event collector properly a couple steps need to be
  completed prior to setting up this event:
    1. Configure an index to ingest the data.
       * Go to Settings > Index.
       * New Index.
    2. Configure the collector.
       * Go to Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector.
       * Add New.
       * Name does not matter, but ensure indexer acknowledgement is OFF.
       * Set `Selected Indexes` to the index configured in step 1.
       * Save API key for this event.
    3. Set Global settings.
       * Go to Settings > Data Inputs > HTTP Event Collector > Global Settings
       * Ensure `All Tokens` is set to ENABLED
       * Copy the HTTP Port Number for this event
       
       > Note: `Enable SSL` only works if SSL is properly configured on your
       Splunk server -- meaning you have proper certificates and DNS. If you are
       accessing your Splunk instance by IP, `Enable SSL` should be set to OFF.
