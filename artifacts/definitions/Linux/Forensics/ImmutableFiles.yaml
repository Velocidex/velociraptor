name: Linux.Forensics.ImmutableFiles
description: |
  Searches the filesystem for immutable files.

  Attackers sometimes enable immutable files in Linux. This prevents files from
  being modified. However this is sometimes a strong signal.

  NOTE: We use the ext4 accessor to parse the low level filesystem.

precondition: |
  SELECT * FROM info() where OS = 'linux'

parameters:
  - name: SearchFilesGlob
    default: /home/*
    description: Use a glob to define the files that will be searched.
  - name: OneFilesystem
    default: N
    type: bool
    description: When set we do not follow a link to go on to a different filesystem.

  - name: DoNotFollowSymlinks
    type: bool
    default: N
    description: If specified we are allowed to follow symlinks while globbing

column_types:
  - name: ATime
    type: timestamp
  - name: MTime
    type: timestamp
  - name: CTime
    type: timestamp
