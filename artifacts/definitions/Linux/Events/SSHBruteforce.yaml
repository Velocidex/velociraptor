name: Linux.Events.SSHBruteforce
description: |
  A monitoring artifact which detects a successful SSH login preceded by some
  failed attempts within the last hour.

  This is particularly important in the case of SSH brute force attacks. If one
  of the brute force password attempts succeeded, the password guessing program
  will likely report the success and move on. This alert might provide
  sufficient time for admins to lock down the account before attackers can
  exploit the weak password.
