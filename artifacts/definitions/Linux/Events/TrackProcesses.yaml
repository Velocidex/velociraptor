name: Linux.Events.TrackProcesses
description: |
  This artifact uses eBPF and pslist to keep track of running
  processes by using the Velociraptor process tracker.

  The process tracker keeps track of exited processes, and resolves
  process call chains from it in memory cache.

  This event artifact enables the global process tracker and makes it
  possible to run many other artifacts that depend on the process
  tracker.

  NOTE: Unlike `Windows.Events.TrackProcesses`, the eBPF program is
  already built into Velociraptor so this artifact does not depend on
  external tools.
