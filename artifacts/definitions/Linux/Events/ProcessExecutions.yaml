description: |
  This artifact collects process execution logs from the Linux kernel.

  This artifact relies on the presence of `auditctl` usually included
  in the auditd package. On Ubuntu you can install it by using:

  ```
  apt-get install auditd
  ```

precondition: SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'linux'

type: CLIENT_EVENT

required_permissions:
  - EXECVE

parameters:
  - name: pathToAuditctl
    default: /sbin/auditctl
    description: We depend on auditctl to install the correct process execution rules.

  - query: |
