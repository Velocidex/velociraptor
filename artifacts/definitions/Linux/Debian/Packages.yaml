name: Linux.Debian.Packages
description: |
 List all packages installed on the system, both deb packages and "snaps".
 The installed deb package information is fetched from the DPKG status file,
 while the snap package list is fetched from the snap daemon through a UNIX
 socket HTTP call (since detailed snap package information is not easily
 in files).

 The following columns are parsed from the DPKG status file:

  - Package
  - InstalledSize
  - Version
  - Source
  - _Description
  - Architecture

 The following columns are parsed from the snap package response (/v2/snaps):

 - Name
 - _Summary
 - _Description
 - InstalledSize
 - Publisher
 - InstalledAt
 - Version
 - Channel

 Both package sources provide more information than this and, and the artifact
 can easily be modified to include more details.

     list through a HTTP API call. If snap is not used, the failed query
     response will simply be ignored.
