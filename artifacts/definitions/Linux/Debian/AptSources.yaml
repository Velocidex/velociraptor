  Parse Debian apt sources.

  This Artifact searches for all apt sources files and parses all
  fields in both one–line `*.list` files and `*.sources` files
  (deb822-style format). The results are presented both in a readable
  table and a flattened version for parsing.

  `*.list` files contains lines of the form

  ```
  deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted
  deb-src [arch=amd64,i386 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/foo.gpg] https://foo.bar.baz/ubuntu/main jammy main restricted universe multiverse # Comment
  ```

  deb indicates a source for binary packages, and deb-src instructs APT where
  to find source code for packages.

  `*.sources` files (deb822-style format) are in the form of key–value
  lines, and as opposed to the one–line format, they may contain
  multiple URIs, components and types (deb/deb-src), along with
  embedded GPG keys. Example:

  ```
  Types: deb deb-src
  URIs: file:/home/apt/debian http://foo.bar.baz/main
  Suites: unstable
  Components: main contrib non-free
  ```

  The exported function `parse_aptsources(OSPath, flatten)` parses
  both formats and returns an (optionally flattened) table with

   - OSPath
   - Types (deb/deb-src)
   - Components (e.g. main/contrib/non-free/restricted,universe)
   - Suites (e.g. unstable/bookworm/jammy)
   - _URIBase (.e.g us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/)
   - _Transport (e.g. http/https/file/cdrom/ftp)
   - URIs (e.g. http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/)

  Any option is added to an individual column. The most common options
  are

   - Architectures (e.g. amd64/i386/armel)
   - Signed-By (e.g. /usr/share/keyrings/osquery.gpg)

  All known option names are transformed to the plural PascalCase
  variants as listed in the sources.list man page. Any undocumented
  options will still be included in the results, with names unchanged.
  Options in the one-line format of the form "lang+=de"/"arch-=i386"
  will be put in columns like "Languages-Add"/"Architectures-Remove",
  matching the option names having the same effect in deb822.

  Entries in deb822 sources files may be disabled by including
  "Enabled: no" instead of commenting out all lines. If this field
  is not present with a falsly value, the entry is enabled. Use the
  exported functions DebTrue()/DebFalse() to correctly parse all
  accepted true/false strings, or use the VQL suggestion "Only enabled
  sources" to filter on this column (true), if present.

  If the GPG key is embedded in a .sources file, the whole GPG key
  will be included in the cell. Otherwise the value will be a file
  path. Use the VQL suggestion "Hide embedded GPG keys" to replace
  embedded GPG keys with "(embedded)" in the results. In order to
  inspect the keys themselves (files or embedded data), use the
  exchange artifact Linux.Debian.GPGKeys.

  If the function parameter "flatten" is False, multi–value fields
  (like Components) will be combined in a single space-separated
  string in each row.

  In addition to the two apt sources tables, a third table correlates
  information from InRelease and Release files to provide additional
  metadata. The modification timestamps may tell when the package
  lists where last updated.
