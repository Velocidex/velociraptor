  This artifact leverages tcpdump to natively capture packets.

  The `Duration` parameter is used to define how long (in seconds) the capture should be.  Specific interfaces can be defined using the `Interface` parameter, otherwise the artifact defaults to an interface assignment of `any`.

  A `BPF` can also be supplied to filter the captured traffic as desired.

  - EXECVE
