description: |
  SSH Private keys can be either encrypted or unencrypted. Unencrypted
  private keys are more risky because an attacker can use them without
  needing to unlock them with a password.

  In particular, AWS instances are usually accessed by way of an SSH
  key pair generated by the AWS console. This key is not encrypted by
  default and it is possible that administrators simply save the key
  on their systems without encrypting it.

  This artifact searches for private keys in the usual locations and
  also records if they are encrypted or not. Not all key types are
  supported

  NOTE: In order to encrypt your private key run:

  ```
  ssh-keygen -p -f my_private_key
  ```

  Change the glob to /** if you would like to search the entire filesystem.
  Be aware, this is an expensive operation.
