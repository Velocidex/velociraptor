          This query resolves the public keys in the known hosts file
          with the collected public keys from all hosts.

          This works best when this cell applies to a hunt collection
          from a wide number of hosts. It helps to resolve the
          hostnames from known hosts to real host names (these are
          usually hashed within the file).

          This artifact helps to establish historical SSH access from
          one machine to another machine.
