name: System.VFS.DownloadFile
description: |
  This is an internal artifact used by the GUI to populate the
  VFS. You may run it manually if you like, but typically it is
  launched by the GUI when the user clicks the "Collect from client"
  button at the file "Stats" tab.

  If you run it yourself (or via the API) the results will also be
  shown in the VFS view.

parameters:
  - name: Path
    description: The path of the file to download.
    default: /
  - name: Components
    type: json_array
    description: Alternatively, this is an explicit list of components.
  - name: Accessor
    default: file
  - name: Recursively
    type: bool
    description: |
      If specified, Path is interpreted as a directory and
      we download all files below it.
  - name: UPLOAD_IS_RESUMABLE
    type: bool
    default: N
    description: If set the uploads can be resumed if the flow times out or errors.
