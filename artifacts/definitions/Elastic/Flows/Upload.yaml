name: Elastic.Flows.Upload
description: |
  This server side event monitoring artifact waits for new artifacts
  to be collected from endpoints and automatically uploads those to an
  elastic server.

  We use the artifact name as the name of the index. This allows users
  to adjust the index size/lifetime according to the artifact it is
  holding.

  NOTE: Elastic is a database and still must have a stable
  schema. This means that artifacts that produce inconsistent columns
  and types will **NOT** work as expected. What will happen is that
  the first row that is inserted will create the Elastic database
  schema (In Elastic terminology "mapping") and then any subsequent
  row with a different type for these fields will be rejected by
  Elastic.

  In particular this does not work with event logs because event logs
  have a varied schema (The EventData field is a free form field
  depending on the event log itself). Therefore forwarding event log
  data to Elastic with this artifact will cause Elastic to drop many
  events!! This artifact is not suitable for forwarding Windows Event
  Logs!
