name: Admin.System.CompressUploads
description: |
  Compresses all uploaded files.

  When artifacts collect files they are normally stored on the server
  uncompressed. This artifact watches all completed flows and
  compresses the files in the file store when the flow completes. This
  is very useful for cloud based deployments with limited storage
  space or when collecting large files.

  In order to run this artifact you would normally run it as part of
  an artifact acquisition process:

  ```
  $ velociraptor --config /etc/server.config.yaml artifacts acquire Admin.System.CompressUploads
  ```

  Note that there is nothing special about compressed files - you can
  also just run `find` and `gzip` in the file store. Velociraptor will
  automatically decompress the file when displaying it in the GUI
  text/hexdump etc.
