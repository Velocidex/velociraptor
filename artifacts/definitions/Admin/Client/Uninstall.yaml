  Uninstall Velociraptor from the endpoint.

  This artifact uninstalls a Velociraptor client (or any other MSI
  package) from the endpoint.

  Typically the client will be hard terminated during the uninstall
  process, so on the server it would appear that the collection is not
  completed. This is normal.

  NOTE: Be careful with the DisplayNameRegex to ensure you do not
  uninstall another package accidentally.
