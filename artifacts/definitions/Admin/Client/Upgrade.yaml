  Remotely push new client updates.

  NOTE: This artifact requires that you supply a client MSI using the
  tools interface. Simply click on the tool in the GUI and upload a
  pre-packaged MSI.

  While typically the MSI will contain the Velociraptor windows
  client, you can install any other MSI as well by customizing this
  artifact or uploading a different msi file.

  - name: WindowsMSI

      The MSI file is typically very large and we do not want to
      overwhelm the server so we stagger the download over this many
      seconds.

      SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'

      // Call the binary and return all its output in a single row.
      // If we fail to download the binary we do not run the command.
