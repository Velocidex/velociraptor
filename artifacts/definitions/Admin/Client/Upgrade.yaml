  Remotely push new client updates.

  NOTE: This artifact requires that you supply a client MSI using the
  tools interface. Simply click on the tool in the GUI and upload a
  pre-packaged MSI.

  While typically the MSI will contain the Velociraptor windows
  client, you can install any other MSI as well by customizing this
  artifact or uploading a different msi file.
