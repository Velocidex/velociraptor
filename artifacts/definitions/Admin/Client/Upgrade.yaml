  Remotely push new client updates.

  NOTE: The updates can be pulled from any web server. You need to
  ensure they are properly secured with SSL and at least a random
  nonce in their path. You may configure the Velociraptor server to
  serve these through the public directory. Simply place the MSI in
  the public directory within the data store and set the URL below.

required_permissions:
  - EXECVE

parameters:
  - name: clientURL
    description: The URL to fetch the MSI package.
    default: http://127.0.0.1:8000/public/velociraptor.msi

sources:
  - precondition:
      SELECT OS From info() where OS = 'windows'
    queries:
      # Wait a random amount of time so this can be run in a
      # hunt. Otherwise all clients will attempt to download the same
      # file at the same time probably overloading the server.
      - LET _ <= SELECT sleep(time=rand(range=600)) FROM scope()

      - SELECT * from foreach(

            FROM http_client(url=clientURL, tempfile_extension=".msi")
         },

            )
