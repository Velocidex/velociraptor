  Remotely push new client updates.

  NOTE: This artifact requires that you supply a client MSI by using the
  tools interface. Simply click on the tool in the GUI and upload a
  pre-packaged MSI.

  While typically the MSI will contain the Velociraptor windows
  client, you can install any other MSI as well by customizing this
  artifact or uploading a different MSI file.

      The MSI file is typically very large and we do not want to
      overwhelm the server so we stagger the download over this many
      seconds.
