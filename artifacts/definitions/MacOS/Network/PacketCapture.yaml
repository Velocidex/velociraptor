  This artifact leverages tcpdump to natively capture packets.

  The `Duration` parameter is used to define how long (in seconds) the
  capture should be.  Specific interfaces can be defined using the
  `Interface` parameter, otherwise the artifact defaults to an
  interface assignment of `any`.

  A `BPF` can also be supplied to filter the captured traffic as
  desired.

  NOTE: This requires tcpdump to be already installed.
