description: |
   This artifact provides details around the TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) database, and can help reveal when access to system services has been added or modified for an application.
   
   Note that this artifact has only been tested on macOS Big Sur, and that the `allowed`, and `prompt_count` columns will need to be used in place of the `auth_value`, `auth_reason`, and `auth_version` columns for Catalina and prior.
