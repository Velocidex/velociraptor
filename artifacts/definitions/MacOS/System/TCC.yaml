description: |
   This artifact provides details around the TCC (Transparency,
   Consent, and Control) database, and can help reveal when access to
   system services has been added or modified for an application.

   Note that this artifact has only been tested on macOS Big Sur, and
   that the `allowed`, and `prompt_count` columns will need to be used
   in place of the `auth_value`, `auth_reason`, and `auth_version`
   columns for Catalina and prior.
