  **Description**:
  This artifact examines the contents of the user's dock.  The property list entry for each application represented within the dock can be modified to point to a malcious application.
   By comparing the application name, CFURLString, and book, we can gather greater context to assist in determining if an adversary may have tampered with an entry.
