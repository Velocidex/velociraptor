  This artifact examines the contents of the user's dock.  The
  property list entry for each application represented within the dock
  can be modified to point to a malcious application.

   By comparing the application name, CFURLString, and book, we can
   gather greater context to assist in determining if an adversary may
   have tampered with an entry, or if an entry has been added to
   emulate a legitimate application.
