  Parse Debian apt sources.

  We first search for *.list files which contain lines of the form

  deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ bionic main restricted

  For each line we construct the cache file by spliting off the
  section (last component) and replacing / and " " with _.

  We then try to open the file. If the file exists we parse some
  metadata from it. If not we leave those columns empty.
