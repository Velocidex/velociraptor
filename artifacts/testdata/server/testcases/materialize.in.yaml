Queries:
- LET VQL_MATERIALIZE_ROW_LIMIT <= 2

# This materialized query will contain 1 row and will be memory
# resident.
- LET Y <= SELECT "Hello" FROM scope()
- SELECT * FROM Y

# This should overflow and be disk resident. We can still select from
# it normally.
- LET X <= SELECT * FROM range(end=100)
- SELECT * FROM X LIMIT 5

# The following are not really supported for file backed materializers
# because they may overflow the result JSON.
- SELECT X, X[0] FROM scope()

# Same thing is OK for in memory materializers because these should be
# small.
- SELECT Y, Y[0] FROM scope()

# Check that log messages are emitted by VQL when switching to file
# based

  SELECT Log[:100] FROM test_read_logs()
  WHERE Log =~ "Materialize of LET X: Expand larger than 2 rows, VQL will switch to tempf" AND NOT Log =~ "SELECT"
