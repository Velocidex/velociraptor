# The above should emit some errors so check for them now.

# 1. ssh: no key found shows that ssh accessor is receiving the
#    bogus key and trying to parse it.
# 2. Failed to apply remapping - remapping failed to apply this will
#    wipe all accessors from the device manager.
# 3. Unknown filesystem accessor file - the file accessor is no
#    longer available. This ensures we dont accidentally operate on
#    the host filesystem if the mapping is broken.
