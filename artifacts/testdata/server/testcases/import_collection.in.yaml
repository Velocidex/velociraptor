Queries:
  # Client IDs are random so we sanitize them in the results below.
  - LET Sanitize(X) = regex_replace(re="[CF]\\.[0-9a-z]+", replace="C.ID", source=X)

  # Import a collection once
  - LET X <= SELECT * FROM Artifact.Server.Utils.ImportCollection(
      Hostname="FooBarHost",
      Path=srcDir+"/vql/tools/collector/fixtures/import.zip")

  # Import the same collection again - it should re-use the same client id
  - LET Y <= SELECT * FROM Artifact.Server.Utils.ImportCollection(
      Hostname="FooBarHost",
      Path=srcDir+"/vql/tools/collector/fixtures/import.zip")

  # Make sure the client ids were the same
  - SELECT X[0].ClientId = Y[0].ClientId AS ClientIdEqual
    FROM scope()

  # Delete the new clients that were created (exclude time dependent data)
  - SELECT Sanitize(X=vfs_path) AS vfs_path
    FROM Artifact.Server.Utils.DeleteClient(
       ClientIdList=[X[0].ClientId, Y[0].ClientId], ReallyDoIt=TRUE)
    WHERE NOT vfs_path =~ "monitoring"
    Order by vfs_path
