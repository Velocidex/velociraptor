# A sequence runs multiple queries and stores their rows in a memory
# fifo buffer (expiring old rows). For each new row that is inserted,
# the `query` is run to produce rows. If a row is found, the fifo is
# reset.

# The `sequence()` plugin is very useful to correlate temporally close
# events from multiple queries - for example, say a process execution
# query and a network query. The `query` can then search for relevant
# network event closely followed by a process event.
Queries:
  - SELECT * FROM sequence(
    a={
     SELECT 1 AS A FROM scope()
    },
    b={
     SELECT 2 AS A FROM scope()
    },
    c={
     SELECT 3 AS A FROM scope()
    },
    query={
      SELECT A AS FoundA, {
        SELECT A FROM SEQUENCE
        WHERE  A = 2
      } AS FoundB
      FROM SEQUENCE
      WHERE A = 1 AND FoundB
    })
