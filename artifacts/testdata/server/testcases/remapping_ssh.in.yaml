  LogRegex: "While parsing private key: ssh: no key found|remap: Failed to apply remapping|Unknown filesystem accessor file"

Queries:
  - LET _ <= remap(config=RemappingTemplate)

  # Test that we are launching the ssh accessor
  - SELECT * FROM glob(
       globs='/*', root='/remote/mnt/foobar', accessor="file")

  # The above should emit some errors so check for them now.

  # 1. ssh: no key found shows that ssh accessor is receiving the
  #    bogus key and trying to parse it.
  # 2. Failed to apply remapping - remapping failed to apply this will
  #    wipe all accessors from the device manager.
  # 3. Unknown filesystem accessor file - the file accessor is no
  #    longer available. This ensures we dont accidentally operate on
  #    the host filesystem if the mapping is broken.
