To disable a particular completion character in\r\nthe registry, use the value for space (0x20) as it is not a valid\r\ncontrol character.\r\n\r\nCompletion is invoked when you type either of the two control\r\ncharacters.  The completion function takes the path string to the left\r\nof the cursor appends a wild card character to it if none is already\r\npresent and builds up a list of paths that match.  It then displays the\r\nfirst matching path.  If no paths match, it just beeps and leaves the\r\ndisplay alone.  Thereafter, repeated pressing of the same control\r\ncharacter will cycle through the list of matching paths.  Pressing the\r\nShift key with the control character will move through the list\r\nbackwards.  If you edit the line in any way and press the control\r\ncharacter again, the saved list of matching paths is discarded and a new\r\none generated.  The same occurs if you switch between file and directory\r\nname completion.  The only difference between the two control characters\r\nis the file completion character matches both file and directory names,\r\nwhile the directory completion character only matches directory names.\r\nIf file completion is used on any of the built in directory commands\r\n(CD, MD or RD) then directory completion is assumed.\r\n\r\nThe completion code deals correctly with file names that contain spaces\r\nor other special characters by placing quotes around the matching path.\r\nAlso, if you back up, then invoke completion from within a line, the\r\ntext to the right of the cursor at the point completion was invoked is\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nThe special characters that require quotes are:\r\n     \u003cspace\u003e\r\n     \u0026()[]{}^=;!'+,`~\r\n",
