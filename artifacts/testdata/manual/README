This directory contains artifacts used for manual testing.

We use manual testing only rarely and only to verify backwards
compatibility with older client versions. Velociraptor attempts to
maintain backwards compatibility with clients officially 2 versions
behind the current release, but usually much more than that.

We have automated testing to ensure current clients work with the
current server, but we currently need to resort to manual testing of
older clients with current server.

This directory contains some artifacts to assist in that.
